A graphical example would be a straight line fit to data exhibiting quadratic behavior overall. Precision is a description of variance and generally can only be improved by selecting information from a comparatively larger space. The option to select many data points over a broad sample space is the ideal condition for any analysis. However, intrinsic constraints (whether physical, theoretical, computational, etc.) will always play a limiting role. The limiting case where only a finite number of data points are selected over a broad sample space may result in improved precision and lower variance overall, but may also result in an overreliance on the training data (overfitting). This means that test data would also not agree as closely with the training data, but in this case the reason is due to inaccuracy or high bias. To borrow from the previous example, the graphical representation would appear as a high-order polynomial fit to the same data exhibiting quadratic behavior. Note that error in each case is measured the same way, but the reason ascribed to the error is different depending on the balance between bias and variance.

When an agent has limited information on its environment, the suboptimality of an RL algorithm can be decomposed into the sum of two terms: a term related to an asymptotic bias and a term due to overfitting. The asymptotic bias is directly related to the learning algorithm (independently of the quantity of data) while the overfitting term comes from the fact that the amount of data is limited.\n",

They have argued (see references below) that the human brain resolves the dilemma in the case of the typically sparse, poorly-characterised training-sets provided by experience by adopting high-bias/low variance heuristics. This reflects the fact that a zero-bias approach has poor generalisability to new situations, and also unreasonably presumes precise knowledge of the true state of the world. The resulting heuristics are relatively simple, but produce better inferences in a wider variety of situations.\n",

However, complexity will make the model \"move\" more to capture the data points, and hence its variance will be larger.\\n',\n",

       " 'Dimensionality reduction and feature selection can decrease variance by simplifying models. Similarly, a larger training set tends to decrease variance. Adding features (predictors) tends to decrease bias, at the expense of introducing additional variance. Learning algorithms typically have some tunable parameters that control bias and variance; for example,\\n',\n",
       " 'One way of resolving the trade-off is to use mixture models and ensemble learning.[14][15] For example, boosting combines many \"weak\" (high bias) models in an ensemble that has lower bias than the individual models, while bagging combines \"strong\" learners in a way that reduces their variance.\\n',\n",
       " 'Model validation methods such as cross-validation (statistics) can be used to tune models so as to optimize the trade-off.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the case of k-nearest neighbors regression, when the expectation is taken over the possible labeling of a fixed training set, a closed-form expression exists that relates the bias–variance decomposition to the parameter k:[8]:\\u200a37,\\u200a223\\u200a\\n',\n",

The bias (first term) is a monotone rising function of k, while the variance (second term) drops off as k is increased. In fact, under \"reasonable assumptions\" the bias of the first-nearest neighbor (1-NN) estimator vanishes entirely as the size of the training set approaches infinity.[12]\\n',\n",
       " 'The bias–variance decomposition forms the conceptual basis for regression regularization methods such as Lasso and ridge regression. Regularization methods introduce bias into the regression solution that can reduce variance considerably relative to the ordinary least squares (OLS) solution.  Although the OLS solution provides non-biased regression estimates, the lower variance solutions produced by regularization techniques provide superior MSE performance.\\n',\n",
       " 'The bias–variance decomposition was originally formulated for least-squares regression. For the case of classification under the 0-1 loss (misclassification rate), it is possible to find a similar decomposition.[16][17] Alternatively, if the classification problem can be phrased as probabilistic classification, then the expected squared error of the predicted probabilities with respect to the true probabilities can be decomposed as before.[18]\\n',\n",
       " 'It has been argued that as training data increases, the variance of learned models will tend to decrease, and hence that as training data quantity increases, error is minimized by methods that learn models with lesser bias, and that conversely, for smaller training data quantities it is ever more important to minimize variance.[19]\\n',\n",
       " 'Even though the bias–variance decomposition does not directly apply in reinforcement learning, a similar tradeoff can also characterize generalization. When an agent has limited information on its environment, the suboptimality of an RL algorithm can be decomposed into the sum of two terms: a term related to an asymptotic bias and a term due to overfitting. The asymptotic bias is directly related to the learning algorithm (independently of the quantity of data) while the overfitting term comes from the fact that the amount of data is limited.[20]\\n',\n",
       " 'While widely discussed in the context of machine learning, the bias–variance dilemma has been examined in the context of human cognition, most notably by Gerd Gigerenzer and co-workers in the context of learned heuristics. They have argued (see references below) that the human brain resolves the dilemma in the case of the typically sparse, poorly-characterised training-sets provided by experience by adopting high-bias/low variance heuristics. This reflects the fact that a zero-bias approach has poor generalisability to new situations, and also unreasonably presumes precise knowledge of the true state of the world. The resulting heuristics are relatively simple, but produce better inferences in a wider variety of situations.[21]\\n',\n",
       " 'Geman et al.[12] argue that the bias–variance dilemma implies that abilities such as generic object recognition cannot be learned from scratch, but require a certain degree of \"hard wiring\"   that is later tuned by experience.  This is because model-free approaches to inference require impractically large training sets if they are to avoid high variance.\\n']"

       " ('Katar (dagger)',\n",
       "  'The katar is a type of push dagger from the Indian subcontinent.[1] The weapon is characterized by its H-shaped horizontal hand grip which results in the blade sitting above the user\\'s knuckles. Unique to the Indian subcontinent, it is the most famous and characteristic of Indian daggers.[2] Ceremonial katars were also used in worship.[3]\\nHaving originated in South India, the weapon\\'s earliest name-form was likely the Tamil kaṭṭāri (கட்டாரி). It is alternatively known in Tamil as kuttuvāḷ (குத்துவாள்) which means \"stabbing blade\". This was adapted into Sanskrit as kaṭār (कट्टार) or kaṭārī.\\nOther regional names for the weapon include kaṭhāri (ಕಠಾರಿ) in Kannada, kathari (కఠారి) in Telugu, kaṭāra (കട്ടാര) in Malayalam, kaṭyāra (कट्यार) in Marathi, kāṭār, (ਕਟਾਰ) in Panjabi, and kirat Dewan language|(chhuiket) in nepalkaṭāra (कटार) or kaṭāri in Hindi.[citation needed]\\nThe katar was created in Southern India,[4] its earliest forms being closely associated with the 14th-century Vijayanagara Empire.[2] It may have originated with the mustika, a method of holding a dagger between the middle and index finger[5] still used in kalaripayattu and gatka today. The real name of this is \"Kidaari\" is from the ancient Tamil warfare class of weapons. Kidaari derived from the term \"Kedayam Ari\" meaning the \"Shield Splitter\" in Tamil. The name indicates this weapon being used to break shields and armor. The weapon was used by many ethnic Tamil infantry units aka \"Kaalatpadai\". This falls under the \"mushtikai\" class of Indian weapon system. \"Mushti\" means the fingers closed and \"kai\" means arm. \\nA Tamil king would be gifted with a golden Kidari as a token of loyalty from the Kaalatpadai General. It was worn as a symbol of respect by the king to the soldiers who lay down their lives for him in war without any hesitation. Later Chhatrpati Shivaji Maharaj was gifted with a Kidaari during his conquest to Tamil Nadu. A specific type of dagger might have been designed for this, as maustika is described vaguely as a \"fist dagger\" in the arsenal list of Abu\\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.[5] One of the most famous groups of early katar come from the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom of the 17th century.[1][6][2][7] Katar dating back to this period often had a leaf- or shell-like knucklebow curving up from the top of the blade to protect the back of the hand.[5] This form is today sometimes called a \"hooded katara\" but the knuckleguard was discarded altogether by the later half of the 17th century.[8] As the weapon spread throughout the region it became something of a status symbol, much like the Southeast Asian kris or the Japanese katana. Princes and nobles were often portrayed wearing a katar at their side. This was not only a precaution for self-defense, but also meant to show their wealth and position. Mughal nobility would even hunt tigers with a katar.[2]\\nSome modern katar designs may include single-shot pistols built into either side of the weapon. In the 18th century, some traditional katar were refurbished with this innovation. The katar ceased to be in common use by the 19th century, though they were still forged for decorative purposes. During the 18th and 19th century, a distinctive group of katar were produced at Bundi in Rajasthan. They were ornately crafted and their hilts were covered in gold foil. These katar were shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Crystal Palace, London. Since then, the weapon has sometimes been mistakenly referred to in English as a \"Bundi dagger\".[citation needed]\\nThe basic katar has a short, wide, triangular blade. Its peculiarity lies in the handle which is made up of two parallel bars connected by two or more cross-pieces, one of which is at the end of the side bars and is fastened to the blade. The remainder forms the handle which is at right angle to the blade. Some handles have long arms extending across the length of the user\\'s forearm. The handle is generally of all-steel construction and may be gilded or otherwise decorated. [2]\\nThe blade, typically measuring 30–90\\xa0cm (12–35\\xa0in) in length, is usually cut with a number of fullers. Most katar have straight blades, but in south India they are commonly wavy.[2] South Indian blades are often made broad at the hilt and taper in straight lines to the point, and elaborately ribbed by grooves parallel to the edges. Occasionally the blades are slightly curved. Some blades are forked into two points, and one decorative variation includes a hollow outer blade which hinges opens to expose a smaller blade inside.\\nThe force of a katar thrust could be so great that many blades were thickened at the point to prevent them from bending or breaking. This also strengthened their use against mail. Katar with thickened tips are commonly described as \"armour-piercing\", but it is likely that only narrow and slender blades made this function possible. Such a weapon was capable of piercing textile or mail.[citation needed]\\nThe Indian nobility often wore ornamental katar as a symbol of their social status. The hilts may be covered in enamel, gems, or gold foil. Similarly, figures and scenes were chiselled onto the blade. Sheaths, generally made from watered steel, were sometimes pierced with decorative designs. The heat and moisture of India\\'s climate made steel an unsuitable material for a dagger sheath, so they were covered in fabric such as velvet or silk. Some katar served as a sheath to fit one or two smaller ones inside.[citation needed]\\nBecause the katar\\'s blade is in line with the user\\'s arm, the basic attack is a direct thrust identical to a punch, although it could also be used for slashing. This design allows the fighter to put their whole weight into a thrust. The sides of the handle could be used for blocking but it otherwise has little defensive capability. As far back as the 16th century, there was at least one fighting style which focused on fighting with a pair of katar, one in each hand.[2]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Hawkman (Katar Hol)',\n",
       "  'Hawkman (Katar Hol) is a DC Comics superhero. He is the Silver Age, Bronze Age and New 52 Hawkman. Created by Gardner Fox and Joe Kubert, he first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (February–March 1961). There are two versions of Katar Hol, the Silver Age/Pre-Crisis version and the post-Hawkworld/Post-Crisis version.\\n\\nThe Silver Age Hawkman (Katar Hol) was first introduced in The Brave and the Bold #34 by artist Joe Kubert and writer Gardner Fox. At this time DC had already rebooted many of its characters such as the Flash and Green Lantern. Hawkman\\'s first appearance sold well and spawned five more tryout issues in The Brave and the Bold. During these issues, he teamed up with his wife, Hawkgirl, to battle foes on earth as well as on his home planet Thanagar.[2] After Hawkman had concluded his appearances in The Brave and the Bold, he starred in a side strip within Mystery in Space. He appeared in four issues of this series, and teamed up with Adam Strange in some of these adventures.[3]\\nIn 1964, Hawkman was given a bi-monthly solo title. Murphy Anderson took over the art for this series with Gardner Fox continuing as writer. Hawkman occasionally teamed up with The Atom and Adam Strange in his title. Together, Hawkman and Hawkgirl battled such enemies as the Matter Master, the Shadow Thief and Lion-Mane. Hawkman\\'s comic book continued for less than five years before it was canceled at issue #27.[4]\\nAfter declining sales forced the cancellation of his solo magazine, Hawkman teamed up with the Atom and starred in The Atom and Hawkman for seven issues. This series was canceled as well.[5]\\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, Hawkman continued to appear as a member of the Justice League of America, which he had joined back in 1964.[6] He also made regular appearances in World\\'s Finest Comics and Detective Comics, along with a three-issue story in the pages of Showcase. It was not until the mid-1980s when Hawkman received his own title again. In 1986, DC published a four-part miniseries called, The Shadow War of Hawkman.[7] Due to the decent sales of this series, Hawkman received another monthly solo series. It lasted seventeen issues and one Special before it, too, was cancelled.[8]\\nIn 1989, Timothy Truman decided to reboot the Silver Age Hawkman in a three-book series titled Hawkworld.[9] This was the start of the post-Hawkworld version of Katar Hol. While this series was originally meant to just be a retold origin of Hawkman, it spawned yet another Hawkman series. In 1990 DC created the Hawkworld monthly series. This series had two volumes, but was eventually canceled.[10]\\nDuring the mid 1990s–2010s Hawkman had more on-and-off series. However, none of them were of much importance. With all of the different series, Hawkman had been part of, his origin and story had become rather complicated and confusing. At the end of his 3rd series, Hawkman was physically dissolved into nothing.[11] Eventually Hawkman came back, but this time, rather than being the alien policeman that he was in the previous series, he was Carter Hall, the reincarnated Egyptian prince. However this added even more complexity to Hawkman, and the series was canceled.[12]\\nIn 2011, the Silver Age Hawkman was rebooted again as part of The New 52 reboot. His new comic book was titled The Savage Hawkman. Although this Hawkman was the most simple version of the complex character, the series sold poorly and ended after twenty issues.[13] In 2016, Hawkman returned again as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, in a series titled The Death of Hawkman, which concluded after six issues.[14]\\nA new Hawkman title, by Robert Venditti and Bryan Hitch, debuted in June 2018. However this series concerned Carter Hall the reincarnated Egyptian prince version of Hawkman rather than Katar Hol, or Silver Age version of the character.\\nKatar Hol was the imperial prince of his home planet of Thanagar. His father was Paran Katar, renowned ornithologist and inventor.\\nWhen Katar Hol was eighteen, an alien race called the Manhawks invaded Thanagar and began looting the planet. Paran sent young Katar Hol to infiltrate their nest and bring back information on the aliens. Using this information, Paran created a hawk-like battle suit containing advanced technology like his \"Nth metal\". Katar used this hawk-suit and Paran\\'s advanced weaponry to drive the Manhawks away from Thanagar.\\nThat, however, was not the end of the problem. Some Thanagarians had learned the concept of stealing from the Manhawks. Due to the amount of crime, the Thanagarian government created a police force. In honor of Paran Katar and his achievements, the new police force began using his hawk-suit and equipment. Paran headed this new police force, named the Hawk-Police (or Wingmen), and his son became one of the first recruits.\\nKatar soon became one of the most skilled of the Hawk-Police. When a group called the Rainbow Robbers began committing crimes, Katar was teamed up with rookie Shayera Thal to track and apprehend the criminals. During the case, Shayera saved Katar\\'s life, and the two soon fell in love. A few weeks later, Katar proposed to Shayera and the two got married, working together as partners-for-life in the Hawk-Police.\\nAfter ten years of marriage and in the force, the pair were sent to Earth[15] to capture the shape-shifting Thanagarian criminal Byth. During their mission, they meet George Emmett, commissioner of the Midway City Police Department, and told him their alien origin. With Emmett\\'s help, the pair took over his retiring brother Ed\\'s place as museum curators. They adopt the identities as Carter and Shiera Hall. After capturing him and sending him back to Thanagar, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities to learn human police methods. The two acted publicly as the heroes Hawkman and Hawkgirl (later Hawkwoman).\\nThe rest of Hawkman\\'s supporting cast consist of Mavis Trent, museum naturalist and diorama artist who flirts with Katar; Joe Tracy, the museum\\'s publicist; his commanding officer Andar Pul; a large red hawk named Big Red who lives in nearby Hawk Valley; and teenage orphan Charley Parker, the Golden Eagle. Katar gained a variety of unique villainous opponents such as the Shadow Thief, the Matter Master, Ira Quimby (I.Q.), Konrad Kaslak, Chac, the Raven, the Criminal Alliance of the World (or C.A.W.), Lion-Mane, Kanjar Ro, Hyathis, the Fadeaway Man, and the Gentleman Ghost.\\nKatar joined the Justice League of America, where he befriended the Atom. As Hawkman was a conservative, he frequently verbally sparred with his fellow Leaguer Green Arrow, a left-wing liberal.\\nHol left the Justice League for a time when Thanagar was hit by the Equalizer Plague, which caused all Thanagarians to change so that their physical and mental talents, and even their heights, became the same. With the help of the JLA, he was eventually able to reverse the effects of the plague.\\nHowever, in the wake of the plague, Thanagar adopted an expansionist outlook, and went to war with the planet Rann, which orbits Alpha Centauri. This forced Katar and Shayera to choose to fight for or against their own planet, and they elected to oppose Thanagar, becoming exiles on Earth. Around this time, Shayera herself joined the JLA, and took the name Hawkwoman.\\nFollowing the truce between Thanagar and Rann, Thanagar began to secretly try to take over the Earth. Hol opposed their efforts in a furtive \"secret war\" for several years.\\nFollowing the events of DC\\'s miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the histories of Earth-One and Earth-Two are merged. As a result, both Golden Age and Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl/Hawkwoman live on the same Earth. Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged. They took Superman to Krypton (now a gas planet),[16] briefly joined Justice League International, teamed-up with Atom,[17] and helped Animal Man defuse a Thanagarian bomb during Invasion. However, DC reversed this decision and rebooted Hawkman continuity after the 1989 Hawkworld miniseries. Originally, Hawkworld retold the origins of the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but following its success, DC Comics launched a Hawkworld ongoing series set in the present, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. By doing so, several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkwoman\\'s Justice League appearances needed to be fixed.\\nKatar Hol was rebooted in 1989 in the prestige format mini-series Hawkworld by Timothy Truman. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed from 1990–1993, which was then followed up by Hawkman (vol. 3) from 1993–1996.\\nIn this new version Katar Hol was a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, and a child of a privileged family being the son of Paran Katar. Thanagar was a planet which conquered and mined other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realized that this was wrong. He rebelled against the system and favored the old days of Thanagar. He became a student of history and archaeology, and admired Thanagar\\'s legendary hero Kalmoran. Hol became addicted to a recreational drug, and was manipulated by the renegade police captain Byth into killing his own father, and was sent into exile in the Isle of Chance.\\nDuring that time, he found one of the island residents in robes fashioned a pair of wings. Katar, disillusioned, killed him and took his wings. He learned the wings were meant for Hol and that the robed man had natural wings on his back. Horrified on what he has done, the brother of the man he killed helped him deal with withdrawal symptoms from his drug addictions and he made peace with himself.\\nWhen his sentence was up, Hol was sent to Downside. However, he managed to escape and uncover and defeat Byth, who had gained shape-shifting abilities. As a result, he was reinstated in the force and given a new partner, Shayera Thal - a young woman from a lower class of society.\\nJust after Fel Andar left Earth, Katar and Shayera were sent to Earth, where they served as goodwill ambassadors for their home planet and remained for some time fighting both human and alien criminals in places like Chicago\\'s Netherworld. Dubbed by the press as Hawkman III, Katar and Shayera, Hawkwoman II, had a tempestuous working relationship, and eventually, Shayera broke away from Katar, who continued alone.\\nKatar met Carter Hall and Shiera Sanders who returned from Asgard with the rest of the Justice Society. He learns that his father came to Earth during World War II, under the alias \"Perry Carter\". The Golden Age Hawks, Carter and Shiera Hall, were friends with Paran, and were the inspiration of the Wingmen. In one adventure, Carter took an injured Katar to be healed by an old friend, a Cherokee shaman named Naomi (\"Faraway Woman\"). Katar discovers that she had known Paran Katar, his father. She and Paran fell in love, and the two eloped with the Halls serving as witnesses. Thus, Naomi is his birth mother and Katar is a hybrid Human-Thanagarian.\\nDuring the Zero Hour event, Katar Hol was merged with Carter, Shiera, and a \"hawk god\" creature in a new Hawkman version—a living avatar of the hawk god who adventured for a brief time, continuing to prey on criminals and deal out his own brand of fierce justice. He later went insane (tormented by the voices of all the previous hawk-avatars in his head), until he was eventually banished to Limbo by the combined skills of Arion and the Martian Manhunter.\\nBecause of Carter Hall\\'s return from the dead prior to Infinite Crisis, it has been stated that Katar Hol\\'s soul dissipated from the Limbo/Realm of the Hawk God and is now deceased. Carter Hall currently inhabits a reconstructed version of Katar Hol\\'s post-Zero Hour body, which mostly resembles Carter Hall, but with darker hair and a more barbaric frame.\\nAs part of DC\\'s 2011 company-wide title relaunch, The New 52, Katar Hol was re-established as the DCU\\'s Hawkman, using the name Carter Hall. His origin has yet to be fully explained since he appears to not know his alien heritage, believing himself to be human. Issue #0 explains that Katar Hol was once a proud member of the Thanagarian race, adopted son of their king Thal Provis and lover to the princess Shayera Thal. Unlike other Thanagarians, he was a pacifist; desiring to find an end to centuries of war, he convinced the king to hold a peace conference. However the Daemonites took advantage of this to spread a deadly disease that quickly destroyed all Thanagarians\\' wings and killed their king. The new ruler, son of Provis and Katar\\'s adoptive brother, Corsar, came to believe that only the Nth Metal could save them, but this desire for power sacrificed hundreds of lives, which was apparently rewarded when Katar was accidentally fused with it creating a full body armor and regenerating his wings. But seeing his brother\\'s increasing insanity, Katar refused to let the metal power be distributed, leading to fighting between them and the death of Corsar. Shayera then vows to hunt down Hawkman, also blaming him for her father\\'s death. He runs away in a stolen ship that ends up crashing on earth.[18] During the Rotworld storyline Animal Man travels to a post-apocalyptic future where he is attacked by a Rot-corrupted Hawkman; this version is killed by Steel, Beast Boy and Black Orchid.[19]\\nThanagarians attack the royal house of Rann and seemingly murder Sardath. Because of these actions, Adam Strange is not able to travel to Rann. We later find out that these actions are all a deliberate plan arranged by the antagonist. When Adam finally gets to Rann, he finds out from his wife Alanna that Thanagarians are behind the attack. Adam does not believe this because of his relationship with his JLA teammate, Katar Hol (Hawkman), who is from Thanagar. With assistance from Hawkman, Adam Strange determines that the real culprit is Despero. Using his psionic powers, Despero is able to control the minds of the citizens of Rann, Thanagar and Kalanor to incite skirmishes. His main goal is to steal the Nth metal resources and attack Earth with the Zeta crystals. A final major battle with Strange, Hawkman and Despero ensues. Hawkman sacrifices himself by expelling all the Nth metal in his body through the head of Despero. Strange destroys the Zeta crystals, causing an explosion. The aftermath shows that Adam Strange gets trapped in a wrinkle in space-time. Despero is cast to the edge of the universe along with the skeleton of Hawkman.\\nIn the 2018 Hawkman series, Carter Hall uses a mystic artifact to reveal all of his past lives, suspecting there are gaps in his memories. Katar Hol is revealed to have been one of his prior reincarnations, despite the fact that the two had been alive simultaneously. This causes Hall to realize that he is reincarnating across space as well as time. On Dinosaur Island, Hall finds an ancient artificial cave carved into a mountain, guarded by Fetherians, a tribe of Stone Age winged humanoids. Upon entering the cavern, Hall is transported to Thanagar in the past and encounters Katar at a point in his life prior to traveling to Earth. Katar assumes Hall is his nemesis, the shape-shifting Byth, and the two Hawkmen engage in an aerial chase through the city before ending up on a gigantic statue of Thanagar\\'s mythical hero, Kalmoran. Carter is able to get Katar to listen and convinces him of their common nature.

       " ('Hawkman',\n",
       "  'Hawkman is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, the original Hawkman first appeared in Flash Comics #1, published by All-American Publications in 1940.\\nSeveral incarnations of Hawkman have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and by large, artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named Hawkgirl or Hawkwoman.\\nHawkman is most often depicted as human archaeologist Carter Hall—the modern-day reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prince named Khufu—or as Thanagarian police officer Katar Hol from the planet Thanagar. The character is generally regarded as having one of the most confusing backstories of any in DC Comics, due to a series of reinventions over the years following DC\\'s 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Some writers have attempted to integrate Carter Hall and Katar Hol into one story by linking the Thanagarian aliens to the Egyptian curse that causes Hawkman to reincarnate periodically throughout human history, or by using Carter Hall as Katar Hol\\'s alias, or otherwise depicting the merger of Carter and Katar into one being.\\nThe character has been adapted into other media numerous times, with significant appearances in the animated Justice League Unlimited cartoon, which featured Hawkgirl as a main character, as well as several DC Universe Original Animated Movies.\\nIn live action, the character first appeared onscreen in the two-part 1979 TV special Legends of the Superheroes by Bill Nuckols appearing alongside Adam West and Burt Ward as allies Batman and Robin. Hawkman was later portrayed by Michael Shanks in Smallville and by Falk Hentschel in The CW\\'s Arrowverse family of shows, with both versions favoring the ancient Egyptian version of the character. Hawkman made his cinematic debut portrayed by Aldis Hodge in 2022\\'s Black Adam set in the DC Extended Universe.\\nHawkman first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (1940), and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s. This Hawkman was Carter Hall, a reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian prince Khufu. Hall discovered that the mysterious \"ninth metal\" (later changed simply to \"Nth metal\") could negate the effects of gravity and allow him to fly. He donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter, Hawkman. He also had a companion hawk named Big Red that assisted him in fighting crime. An archaeologist by profession, Hall used ancient weapons from the museum that he curated.\\nHawkman was a charter member of the Justice Society of America, beginning with All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940). In issue #8 he became the JSA\\'s chairman, a position he held until the end of the JSA\\'s run in All Star Comics in 1951. He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure during the Golden Age of Comic Books. He romanced his reincarnated bride, Shiera Saunders, who became the crimefighter Hawkgirl. His first three adventures were drawn by creator Dennis Neville (who modeled Hawkman\\'s costume on the hawkmen characters in the Flash Gordon comic strip by Alex Raymond), then by Sheldon Moldoff, and later by Joe Kubert, who slightly redesigned his mask in Flash Comics # 85 (Jul 1947) and then, one year later, replaced the winged-hawk-like mask with a much simpler yellow cowl in Flash Comics #98 (Aug 1948).\\nAlong with most other superheroes, Hawkman\\'s Golden Age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early 1950s. His last appearance was in All Star Comics #57 (1951).\\nLater in the decade, DC Comics, under editor Julius Schwartz, decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations, but retaining the same names and powers. Following the success of the Flash and Green Lantern, the name \"Hawkman\" was revived in The Brave and the Bold # 34 (Feb–Mar 1961), this time as an alien police officer from the planet Thanagar, though his powers were largely the same. Created by Gardner Fox and Joe Kubert, this Hawkman named Katar Hol came to Earth with his wife Shayera in pursuit of a criminal, and decided to remain on Earth to study earth police methods as well as fight crime. They adopted the names Carter and Shiera Hall and became curators of a museum in Midway City.\\nThis Hawkman became a member of the Justice League of America in issue #31, where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic liberal hero Green Arrow. In the 1960s, it was revealed that the original Hawkman lived on the parallel world of Earth-Two, and that Katar Hol lived on Earth-One. The JLA and JSA had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and 1970s during which the two heroes often met.\\nThe Silver Age Hawkman had his own series for a few years in the \\'60s, but with declining sales it ended at issue #27 and was then merged with that of the Atom. Atom and Hawkman lasted only another year or so before cancellation.\\nIn the late 1970s in Showcase and World\\'s Finest Comics, Thanagar went to war with the planet Rann, the adopted home of Adam Strange. This led to Hawkman and Hawkwoman severing ties with their homeworld, and later fighting The Shadow War of Hawkman (written by Tony Isabella) as the Thanagarians tried secretly to conquer the Earth.\\nThe landmark 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths resulted in a massive revision of much of DC continuity and led to many characters being substantially rewritten. Hawkman was to suffer some of the greatest confusion as successive writers sought to explain his various appearances. In the revised timeline there was a single Earth which had witnessed the JSA in the 1940s and the JLA decades later. Successive revisions sought to establish exactly who had been Hawkman and Hawkwoman at different stages. For the first few years the pre-Crisis incarnations were still used, during which time they were prominent across the DC Universe and joined the latest incarnation of the Justice League.\\nDC decided to reboot Hawkman, in a limited series (which later led to an ongoing series) titled Hawkworld originally by Tim Truman, and later John Ostrander. In this series, Thanagar was a stratified society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself. Katar Hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo. He and his partner Shayera were sent to Earth and remained there for some years until Hol was apparently killed.\\nThis created several continuity errors. Because the new Katar Hol had only just arrived on Earth, someone else had to have been Hawkman previously. In an attempt to resolve the problem it was established through retcons that the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl had continued to operate sporadically after their supposed retirement in 1951 through the 1990s, and that Nth metal originally came from Thanagar. The Halls, and not the Hols, joined the original incarnation of the JLA. Another Hawkman—Fel Andar, a Thanagarian agent—had been the one who joined the Justice League during the 1980s, pretending to be a hero but secretly spying on the League for his Thanagarian masters.\\nThe Zero Hour miniseries muddied the waters further by merging the different Hawkmen into a \"Hawkgod\", who was the focus character in the third volume of the monthly Hawkman series. This version of Hawkman also had a small role in the alternate-future series Kingdom Come. After the end of this series, Hawkman\\'s continuity was considered by DC to be too complicated,[citation needed] and he was absent from comics for several years.\\nIn the late 1990s, the JSA series untangled Hawkman\\'s continuity, establishing him as Carter Hall, a man who—along with Shiera—had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient Egypt, and whose powers were derived from Thanagarian Nth metal, which had been retroactively renamed from \"ninth metal\". The Katar Hol of the Hawkworld series had also come to Earth during the 1990s, as previously established. The 1980s Hawkman Fel Andar returned to Thanagar. The Hawkgod was later revealed to be an avatar of the Hawk aspect of the Red (from which Animal Man receives his powers) and only believed that he was Hawkman.[citation needed]\\nDuring the Identity Crisis miniseries, it was established that Hawkman (Carter Hall) had encouraged the mindwipe of Doctor Light and had actually been the one to initially suggest the idea. His role in the mindwipe was the basis for his enmity with Green Arrow, who felt that interfering with an individual\\'s right to self-determination was beyond the moral right of any organization or government.\\nSubsequently, Hawkman was reincarnated and given a new series in 2002 entitled Hawkman vol. 4, written initially by James Robinson and Geoff Johns, with art by Rags Morales. Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti took over writing duties during the third year of the series. In 2006, the series was retitled Hawkgirl with issue #50 and given a new creative team of Walt Simonson and Howard Chaykin. This series was cancelled with issue #66 in July 2007.\\nHawkman was a major character in the Rann–Thanagar War miniseries, which stemmed from events in Countdown to Infinite Crisis. During this time his continuity was further changed (see Carter Hall section below).\\nThe character then received a new series spinning out of Dark Nights: Metal, helmed by Robert Venditti and Bryan Hitch.[1]\\nIn the days of ancient Egypt, Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the Egyptian priest Hath-Set. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them using a cursed dagger of Nth metal. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as American archaeologist Carter Hall, Chay-Ara as Shiera Saunders, and Hath-Set as scientist Anton Hastor. After touching the same Nth Metal dagger used to kill Khufu, Carter regains the memories of his former life and realizes Hastor is the reincarnation of his ancient foe. When Hastor kidnaps Shiera, using a magic spell to draw her to his lair, Hall uses his newly-refound memories to craft a gravity-defying belt using Nth metal and a winged costume to become Hawkman. Carter successfully rescues Shiera, Anton is killed by electrocution, and Carter and Saunders begin a romantic relationship.\\nCarter Hall and Shiera Saunders had a son together, named Hector Hall, who grew up to also have a superheroic identity as Silver Scarab and later adopted the mantle of Dr. Fate. Hector Hall was a member of the superhero groups Infinity Inc. and the JSA, where he served alongside his father.\\nKatar Hol is an honored police officer on his homeworld of Thanagar. Along with his wife Shayera, they use the anti-gravity belts and their wings to fly and fight criminals. These were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals. The pair were sent to Earth in 1961 to capture the shape-shifting criminal Byth. Following this mission, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities in the United States and learn human police methods. The two adopted covers as a pair of museum curators, Carter and Shiera Hall, and acted publicly as the second Hawkman and the second Hawkgirl (later Hawkwoman).\\nAlthough initially depicted as surviving the Crisis on Infinite Earths intact, Katar Hol was rebooted just a few years afterwards in a prestige-format miniseries named Hawkworld, by Timothy Truman. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed, with writer John Ostrander joining Truman. Katar Hol, a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, rebels against the oppressive system of his planet and is sent into exile. He later escapes and uncovers a renegade police captain Byth. As a result, he is reinstated into the force, given a new partner, Shayera Thal, and sent on a mission on Earth, where he is the third Hawkman.\\nIn DC\\'s The New 52 universe, Hawkman is Katar Hol but uses the name Carter Hall.\\nLate in the 1980s, Thanagarian spy Fel Andar—who had been living on Earth for some time already—fell in love with an Earth woman, Sharon Parker, and they had a son named Charley. Andar was ordered by the Thanagarian government to infiltrate the Justice League and Parker\\'s memories were altered so that she believed she was Hawkwoman and believed that her son was \"Carter Hall Jr.\" instead of Andar\\'s son. Charley Andar later took up the name Hawkman to honor his \"father\" whom he believed to be Carter Hall. When Parker\\'s old memories surface, she exposed Andar\\'s infiltration plot; Andar murdered her and fled to Thanagar. Andar later returned to Earth to help his son become the hero known as Golden Eagle, and saved his life once before being recaptured and returned to Thanagar.\\nWhen Grant Morrison revived the JLA comic book in 1997, they expanded the roster to include over a dozen heroes. With frequent collaborator Mark Millar, they intended to create a new Hawkman with no links to the old characters. This new Hawkman, an Earth-bound angel of the \"Eagle host\" named Zauriel, was to be introduced into the JLA with issue #6 (June 1997). Morrison was denied permission to use the name \"Hawkman\" by DC editorial, which still considered it \"radioactive\", due to the complex post-Crisis continuity problems with the character.\\nIn the Wizard JLA Special, Morrison made an appeal to the fanbase, \"It\\'s a good name and it seems a shame to let it go to waste. We\\'re hoping that fans will figure \\'For God\\'s sake, let\\'s just call him Hawkman and get him in the Justice League as Hawkman,\\' and the editors will relent. We\\'re hoping to start a campaign.\" DC held firm, and the \"Hawkman\" name went unused for several more years.[2]\\nOriginally the Teen Titans member called Golden Eagle, Charley Parker was presumed deceased after an attack by the Wildebeest Society during the event known as Titans Hunt. He was later revealed to be alive in the fourth volume of Hawkman and went on to assist the Carter Hall Hawkman for some time. When Carter Hall seemingly perished, Charley Parker took on the mantle and became the fourth Hawkman, and revealed himself as the son of Carter Hall. In fact, he was actually the son of Fel Andar, and had been responsible for Carter\\'s troubles and his apparent demise. Carter Hall eventually defeated the Golden Eagle, their vendetta was later dropped, and Carter Hall reclaimed his mantle.\\nAll incarnations of Hawkman used the fictional \"ninth metal\" or \"Nth metal\" to defy gravity and allow them to fly. The metal is in their costume\\'s belt, boots, and wings. Its abilities are controlled mentally. Their wings allow them to control their flight, though they can be \"flapped\" through use of shoulder motions. In most comic books, Hawkman is known to have slightly enhanced physical strength.\\nThe Golden Age Hawkman was also granted the ability to breathe underwater by the sea god Poseidon.[3] He also discovered a hidden kingdom of sentient birds led by the old One-Eye, who taught him their language and later sacrificed himself to save Hawkman\\'s life.[4] Among the leading birds was a hawk named Big Red who became a companion and even helped the Golden Age Hawkman solve crimes.[5]\\nThe Silver Age Hawkman also had enhanced senses comparable to a hawk\\'s. He, and sometimes the Golden Age Hawkman as well, was also able to converse with birds, though not command them in the same way that, say, Aquaman could command sea creatures. Hawkman also wore special contact lenses that allowed him to detect beams and radiation.[6]\\nThe Silver Age Hawkman also possessed a Thanagarian police space ship and a variety of science fiction weapons.\\nAll versions of Hawkman prefer to use archaic weaponry—particularly maces, nets, spears, and shields—rather than modern or futuristic weapons. The current incarnation prefers this in part because, having the memories of having lived through many past lives, he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons. In Katar Hol\\'s case, it was too dangerous to use Thanagarian weaponry since there was too great a chance they could be lost or captured and then used or duplicated on Earth. There is, however, one significantly unique weapon Carter employs occasionally: the Claw of Horus. Constructed of Nth metal by Prince Khufu in ancient Egypt, it was delivered to the newly resurrected Carter Hall by the time-displaced Jay Garrick in JSA Book 3: \"The Return of Hawkman\". Later, in Superman-Batman Book 1: \"Public Enemies\", Hawkman used it to defeat Superman, using its Nth metal to channel the Earth\\'s gravitational field. As he explained to Superman, \"Essentially, I just hit you with the planet.\"\\nAll versions of Hawkman have shown enhanced levels of strength. The Golden Age Hawkman was said to have the strength of 12 men but later that idea was dropped. Where as the Golden Age Hawkman\\'s strength appeared natural, it was later explained (with the \\nSilver Age Hawkman) that the Nth metal enables its wielders to carry great weights. The recent incarnation has interpreted this as the Nth metal simply enhancing the strength of the user. Also, several JLA and JSA stories indicate that Thanagar has greater gravity than Earth, and that Thanagarians are naturally stronger than humans because they are adapted to it, similarly to how Atlanteans (e.g. Aquaman) are adapted to deep sea pressures.\\nIt has also been explained in the JSA series that the Nth metal greatly aids in healing, closing wounds almost instantaneously. One example is in the JLA story \"Crisis of Conscience\", in issues 115–118, when Carter\\'s arm is nearly severed during one part of the issue, but the wound has obviously closed and functionality returned by the end of the issue. The Atom has commented that Hawkman laughs at anything less than third-degree burns.\\nThe Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.[7]\\nThe series and character have won several awards over the years, including:\\nHawkman was ranked as the 118th-greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine.[10] IGN also ranked Hawkman as the 56th-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that the best part of Hawkman is his incredibly short fuse. IGN also described him as a complete and total badass.[11]\\n'),\n",

She later obtained a master\\'s degree in development studies and a PhD in African Studies.[2] Founder of the Institute of Black Women in Portugal (INMUNE),[3] she was the first black woman to head a party list in a Portuguese legislative election, namely Livre\\'s electoral list for the 2019 election in Lisbon.\\nIn 2019, Katar Moreira was elected member of the Assembly of the Republic, and her party thus earned its first seat at the Portuguese parliament since its creation in 2014.[4] At the same time, she was one of three black members of parliament. Since joining the parliament, she has presented various policy proposals on tackling racism and colonial legacies in Portugal.[5] Among other initiatives, she proposed in 2020 that items in Portuguese museums obtained from former colonies should be returned to their countries of origin.[5] Because of this André Ventura leader of Chega provoked an outcry in Parliament by saying that Katar Moreira, be to \"sent back to her country of origin. It would be a lot better for everyone\".[6]\\nLivre removed its political confidence from Katar Moreira after a party caucus in January 2020, citing communication and coordination issues with its deputy and accusing Katar Moreira of separating herself from the party \"immediately after the election\".[7] This made Joacine the only deputy without a party (Deputada não inscrita)[8] until Cristina Rodrigues decided to leave People-Animals-Nature in late June 2020.[9]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Katarism',\n",
       "  'Katarism (Spanish: Katarismo) is a political movement in Bolivia, named after the 18th-century indigenous leader Túpac Katari.\\nThe katarist movement began in the early 1970s, recovering a political identity of the Aymara people. The movement was centered on two key understandings, that the colonial legacy continued in the Latin American republics after independence and that the indigenous population constituted the demographic (and thus essentially, the political) majority in Bolivia.[1] Katarism stresses that the indigenous peoples of Bolivia suffer both from class oppression (in the Marxist, economic sense) and ethnic oppression.[2]\\nThe agrarian reform of 1953 had enabled a group of Aymara youth to begin university studies in La Paz in the 1960s. In the city, this group faced prejudices, and katarist thoughts began to emerge among the students. The movement was inspired by the rhetoric of the national revolution as well as by Fausto Reinaga, writer and founder of the Indian Party of Bolivia.[3] The group formed the Julian Apansa University Movement (MUJA), which organized around cultural demands, including bilingual education. Its most prominent leader was Jenaro Flores Santos (who in 1965 returned to the countryside to lead peasants). Another prominent figure was Raimundo Tambo.[4]\\nAt the 1971 Sixth National Peasant Congress, the congress of the National Peasants Confederation, the katarists emerged as a major faction against the pro-government forces.[5] The 1973 Tolata massacre (in which at least 13 Quechua peasants were killed) radicalized the katarist movement.[6] Following the massacre, the katarists issued the 1973 Tiwanaku Manifesto, which viewed Quechua people as economically exploited and culturally and politically oppressed. In this vision, peasant class consciousness and Aymara and Quechua ethnic consciousness were complementary because capitalism and colonialism were the root of exploitation.\\nKatarism made its political breakthrough in the late 1970s through the leading role katarists played in CSUTCB. The katarists pushed the CSUTCB to become more indigenized. Eventually, the katarists split into two groups. The first, a more reformist strain, was led by Victor Hugo Cardenas, who later served as vice president under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, heading efforts to institutionalize a neoliberal, state-led multiculturalism. A second strain articulated a path of Aymara nationalism. A political wing of the movement, the Tupaj Katari Revolutionary Movement (MRTK) was launched.[1] This radical stream of katarism has been represented by Felipe Quispe (aka El Mallku), who took part in founding the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army in the 1980s.[7] This group later became the MIP (Indigenous Movement Pachakuti), which became outspoken critics of the neoliberal Washington Consensus and which coalesced around ethnic-based solidarity. Quispe advocated the creation of a new sovereign country, the Republic of Quillasuyo, named after one of the four regions of the old empire where the Incas conquered the Aymaras. The ex Vice President of Bolivia under Evo Morales, Alvaro Garcia Linera, was a member of this group.\\nKatarist organizations were weakened during the 1980s. In this context NGOs began to appropriate katarist symbols. Populist parties, such as CONDEPA, also began to integrate katarist symbols in their discourse.[8] After the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) had incorporated katarist themes in its 1993 election campaign, other mainstream parties followed suit (most notably the Revolutionary Left Movement).[9]\\n'),\n",

It occupies the Qatar Peninsula on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle East; it shares its sole land border with Saudi Arabia to the south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the Persian Gulf. The Gulf of Bahrain, an inlet of the Persian Gulf, separates Qatar from nearby Bahrain. The capital is Doha, home to over 80% of the country\\'s inhabitants, and the land area is mostly made up of flat, low-lying desert.\\nQatar has been ruled as a hereditary monarchy by the House of Thani since Mohammed bin Thani signed \"an agreement, not a formal treaty\"[18] with Britain in 1868 that recognised its separate status. Following Ottoman rule, Qatar became a British protectorate in 1916 and gained independence in 1971. The current emir is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who holds nearly all executive, legislative, and judicial authority under the Constitution of Qatar.[19] He appoints the prime minister and cabinet. The partially-elected Consultative Assembly can block legislation and has a limited ability to dismiss ministers.\\nIn early 2017, the population of Qatar was 2.6 million, with 313,000 of them Qatari citizens and 2.3 million expatriates.[20] Its official religion is Islam.[21] The country has the fourth-highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world[22] and the eleventh-highest GNI per capita (Atlas method).[23] It ranks 42nd in the Human Development Index, the third-highest HDI in the Arab world.[24] It is a high-income economy, backed by the world\\'s third-largest natural gas reserves and oil reserves.[25] Qatar is one of the world\\'s largest exporters of liquefied natural gas[26] and the world\\'s largest emitter of carbon dioxide per capita.[27]\\nIn the 21st century, Qatar emerged as both a major non-NATO ally of the United States and a middle power in the Arab world. Its economy has risen rapidly through its resource-wealth,[28][29] and its geopolitical power has risen through its media group, Al Jazeera Media Network, and reported support for rebel groups financially during the Arab Spring.[30][31][32] Qatar also forms part of the Gulf Cooperation Council.[3]\\nPliny the Elder, a Roman writer, documented the earliest account pertaining to the inhabitants of the peninsula around the mid-first century AD, referring to them as the Catharrei, a designation that may have derived from the name of a prominent local settlement.[33][34] A century later, Ptolemy produced the first known map to depict the peninsula, referring to it as Catara.[34][35] The map also referenced a town named \"Cadara\" to the east of the peninsula.[36] The term \"Catara\" (inhabitants, Cataraei)[37] was exclusively used until the 18th century, after which \"Katara\" emerged as the most commonly recognised spelling.[36] Eventually, after several variations — \"Katr\", \"Kattar\" and \"Guttur\" — the modern derivative Qatar was adopted as the country\\'s name.[38]In Standard Arabic, the name is pronounced [ˈqɑtˤɑr], while in the local dialect it is [ˈɡɪtˤɑr].[17] English speakers use different approximate pronunciations of the name as the Arabic pronunciations use sounds not often used in English.[39]\\nHuman habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago.[40] Settlements and tools dating back to the Stone Age have been unearthed in the peninsula.[40] Mesopotamian artifacts originating from the Ubaid period (c. 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements.[41] Al Da\\'asa, a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment.[42][43]\\nKassite Babylonian material dating back to the second millennium BC found in Al Khor Islands attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Kassites in modern-day Bahrain.[44] Among the findings were crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds.[42] It has been suggested that Qatar is the earliest known site of shellfish dye production, owing to a Kassite purple dye industry which existed on the coast.[41][45]\\nIn 224 AD, the Sasanian Empire gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf.[46] Qatar played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye.[citation needed] Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in eastern Arabia were introduced to Christianity following the eastward dispersal of the religion by Mesopotamian Christians.[47] Monasteries were constructed and further settlements were founded during this era.[48][49] During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar comprised a region known as \\'Beth Qatraye\\' (Syriac for \"house of the Qataris\").[50] The region was not limited to Qatar; it also included Bahrain, Tarout Island, Al-Khatt, and Al-Hasa.[51]\\nIn 628, the Islamic prophet Muhammad sent a Muslim envoy to a ruler in eastern Arabia named Munzir ibn Sawa Al-Tamimi and requested that he and his subjects accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and accordingly most of the Arab tribes in the region converted to Islam.[52] In the middle of the century, the Muslim conquest of Persia resulted in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.[53]\\nQatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the Umayyad period.[54] In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading.[55][56]\\nSubstantial development in the pearling industry around the Qatari Peninsula occurred during the Abbasid era.[54] Ships voyaging from Basra to India and China would make stops in Qatar\\'s ports during this period. Chinese porcelain, West African coins, and artefacts from Thailand have been discovered in Qatar.[53] Archaeological remains from the 9th century suggest that Qatar\\'s inhabitants used greater wealth to construct higher quality homes and public buildings. Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in Murwab during this period.[57][58] When the caliphate\\'s prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar.[59]\\nQatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi\\'s book, Mu\\'jam Al-Buldan, which alludes to the Qataris\\' fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears.[60]\\nMuch of eastern Arabia was controlled by the Usfurids in 1253, but control of the region was seized by the prince of Ormus in 1320.[61] Qatar\\'s pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income.[62] In 1515, Manuel I of Portugal vassalised the Kingdom of Ormus. Portugal went on to seize a significant portion of eastern Arabia in 1521.[62][63] In 1550, the inhabitants of Al-Hasa voluntarily submitted to the rule of the Ottomans, preferring them to the Portuguese.[64]\\nAfter the fall of the Jabrid Dynasty with the conquest of Bahrain by the Portuguese, the Arabian coast up to Al Hassa came under the rule and influence of the Portuguese empire. Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of Tarout[65] or Al Qatif in 1551.\\nArchaeological finds are still being excavated from one of the Portuguese fortresses that served as a base to dominate the region as Ruwayda[66]. The first representation of Qatar appears on the Portuguese map by Luis Lázaro in 1563, showing the \"city of Qatar\" as a fortress.[67] Having retained a negligible military presence in the area, the Ottomans were expelled by the Bani Khalid tribe and their emirate in 1670.[68]\\nIn 1766, members of the Al Khalifa family of the Utub tribal confederation migrated from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar.[69][70] By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin.[71] In 1783, Qatar-based Bani Utbah clans and allied Arab tribes invaded and annexed Bahrain from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah.[69]\\nFollowing his swearing-in as crown prince of the Wahhabi in 1788, Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz moved to expand Wahhabi territory eastward towards the Persian Gulf and Qatar. After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and Egyptians assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in Bahrain and the Omanis launched an attack against the eastern front.[72][73] Upon being made aware of the Egyptian advance on the western frontier in 1811, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah in order to redeploy his troops. Said bin Sultan, ruler of Muscat, capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power thereafter.[73]\\nAs punishment for piracy, an East India Company vessel bombarded Doha in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the House of Thani was established with Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani as the first leader.[74]\\nAlthough Qatar was considered a dependency of Bahrain, the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of Abu Dhabi, sent a massive naval force to Al Wakrah in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime Qatari–Bahraini War of 1867–68, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah.[75] The Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel Lewis Pelly to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with Qatari sheikhs who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani.[76] The negotiations were the first stage in the development of Qatar as a sheikhdom.[77]\\nUnder military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman Vilayet of Baghdad, Midhat Pasha, the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871.[78] The Ottoman government imposed reformist (Tanzimat) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire.[78] Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule. Qatari-Ottoman relations stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khawr al Udayd. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.[79] This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.[80]\\nIn February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed\\'s opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah (16\\xa0km or 10\\xa0mi west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed\\'s demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim\\'s brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman corvette Merrikh as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 liras, he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim\\'s Al Wajbah Fort under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the Battle of Al Wajbah.[53]\\nEffendi\\'s troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim\\'s advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans\\' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha\\'s cavalry to Hofuf by land.[81] Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar\\'s emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.[82]\\nBy the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha. However, with the outbreak of World War I, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning they found it deserted.[83][84]\\nQatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916[85] when the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its Trucial System of Administration. The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the British government, the latter guaranteed the protection of Qatar from aggression by sea and provide its \\'good offices\\' in the event of an attack by land. This latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.[83][86]\\nOn 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.[83] Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. Exploitation and development were, however, delayed by World War II.[87]\\nThe focus of British interests in Qatar changed after the Second World War with the independence of India, the creation of Pakistan in 1947, and the development of oil in Qatar. In 1949, the appointment of the first British political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo-Qatari relations.[88] Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country\\'s main source of revenue; the pearl trade had gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar\\'s infrastructure. \\nWhen Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years\\' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other Trucial States to create a federation. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the United Arab Emirates.\\nUnder an agreement with the United Kingdom,[89][90] on 3 September 1971, the \"special treaty arrangements\" that were \"inconsistent with full international responsibility as a sovereign and independent state\" were terminated.[90]\\nIn 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the Gulf War, particularly during the Battle of Khafji in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for Saudi Arabian National Guard units that were engaging Iraqi Army troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an airbase to launch aircraft on combat air patrol duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories.[40]\\nIn 1995, Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani seized control of the country from his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, with the support of the armed forces and cabinet, as well as neighbouring states[91] and France.[92] Under Emir Hamad, Qatar experienced a moderate degree of liberalisation, including the launch of the Al Jazeera television station (1996), the endorsement of women\\'s suffrage or right to vote in municipal elections (1999), drafting its first written constitution (2005) and inauguration of a Roman Catholic church (2008).[citation needed]\\nQatar\\'s economy and status as a regional power rapidly grew in the 2000s. According to the UN, the nation\\'s economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade.[93][94] The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of natural gas in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly from an influx of foreigners.[95]\\nIn 2003, Qatar served as the United States Central Command headquarters and one of the main launching sites of the invasion of Iraq.[96] In March 2005, a suicide bombing killed a British teacher[97] at the Doha Players Theatre, shocking the country, which had not previously experienced acts of terrorism. The bombing was carried out by Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali, an Egyptian resident in Qatar who had suspected ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[98][99] The increased influence of Qatar and its role during the Arab Spring, especially during the Bahraini uprising in 2011, worsened longstanding tensions with Saudi Arabia, the neighboring United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.[citation needed]\\nIn 2010, Qatar won the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the first country in the Middle East to be selected to host the tournament. The awarding increased further investment and developments within the nation during the 2010s.[100]  In June 2013, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the emir of Qatar after his father handed over power.[101] Sheikh Tamim has prioritised improving the domestic welfare of citizens, which includes establishing advanced healthcare and education systems, and expanding the country\\'s infrastructure in preparation for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup.[102] Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup from 21 November to 18 December, becoming the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so, and the third Asian country to host it following the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea.[103]\\nQatar is officially a semi-constitutional monarchy,[104][105] but the wide powers retained by the monarchy have it bordering an absolute monarchy[106][107] ruled by the Al Thani family.[108][109] The Al Thani dynasty has been ruling Qatar since the family house was established in 1825.[3] In 2003, Qatar adopted a constitution that provided for the direct election of 30 of the 45 members of a legislature.[3][110][111] The constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, with almost 98% in favour.[112][113] Despite this, the government remains authoritarian.[114][6] Qatari law does not permit the establishment of political bodies or trade unions.[115]\\nThe eighth emir of Qatar is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.[116] The emir has the exclusive power to appoint the prime minister and cabinet ministers who, together, constitute the Council of Ministers, which is the supreme executive authority in the country.[117] The Council of Ministers also initiates legislation.[117]\\nThe Consultative Assembly is made up of 30 popularly-elected members and 15 appointed by the emir. It can block legislation with a simple majority and can dismiss ministers, including the prime minister, with a two-thirds vote. The assembly had its first elections in October 2021 after several postponements.[118][119][120]\\nAccording to Qatar\\'s Constitution, Sharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation,[121][122] although in practice Qatar\\'s legal system is a mixture of civil law and Sharia.[123][124] Sharia is applied to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery, and murder). In some cases, Sharia-based family courts treat a female\\'s testimony as being worth half that of a man.[125] Codified family law was introduced in 2006. Islamic polygyny is permitted.[92]\\nJudicial corporal punishment is a punishment in Qatar. Only Muslims considered medically fit are liable to have such sentences carried out. Flogging is employed as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations.[126] Article 88 of the criminal code declares that the penalty for adultery is 100 lashes.[127] Stoning is a legal punishment in Qatar,[128] and apostasy and homosexuality are crimes punishable by the death penalty; however, the penalty has not been carried out for either crime.[129][130] Blasphemy can result in up to seven years in prison, while proselytising can incur a 10-year sentence.[129][131]\\nAlcohol consumption is partially legal; some five-star luxury hotels are allowed to sell alcohol to non-Muslim customers.[132][133] Muslims are not allowed to consume alcohol, and those caught consuming it are liable to flogging or deportation. Non-Muslim expatriates can obtain a permit to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. The Qatar Distribution Company (a subsidiary of Qatar Airways) is permitted to import alcohol and pork; it operates the only liquor store in the country, which also sells pork to holders of liquor licences.[134][135] Qatari officials had indicated a willingness to allow alcohol in \"fan zones\" at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[136] However, on 18 November, two days before the start of the games, Qatari officials announced alcoholic beverages would not be permitted within the stadiums.[137]\\nIn 2014, a modesty campaign was launched to remind tourists of the country\\'s restrictive dress code.[138] Female tourists were advised not to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses, or short or tight clothing in public. Men were warned against wearing shorts and singlets.[139]\\nQatar\\'s international profile and active role in international affairs have led some analysts to identify it as a middle power. Since 2022, it has been a major non-NATO ally of the United States.[140] Qatar also has particularly strong ties with France,[141] China,[142] Iran,[143] Turkey,[144] as well as a number of Islamist movements in the Middle East such as the Muslim Brotherhood.[145][146][147] The country is an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as a member of the Arab League.[3] Diplomatic missions to Qatar are based in its capital, Doha. \\nRegional relations and foreign policies are characterized by the strategy of balancing and alliance building among regional and great powers. It maintains independent foreign policy and engages in regional balancing to secure its strategic priorities and to have recognition on the regional and international level.[146][148][149] As a comparatively small state in the gulf, Qatar established an \"open-door\" foreign policy where Qatar maintains ties to all parties and regional players in the region.[150]\\n\\nIn 2011, Qatar joined NATO operations in Libya and reportedly armed Libyan opposition groups.[151] It was also a major funder of weapons for rebel groups in the Syrian civil war.[152] Qatar participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.[153] Since the 2000s, Qatar increasingly emerged on a wider foreign policy stage especially as a mediator, such as for Middle Eastern conflicts;[154] for example, Qatar mediated between the rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas in 2006[155] and helped unite Lebanese leaders into forming a political agreement during the 2008 crisis.[156] Qatar has also emerged as mediators in African and Asian affairs, notably holding a peace process for Sudan amid the Darfur conflict[157] and facilitating peace talks for Afghanistan, setting up a political \"office\" for the Afghan Taliban to facilitate talks. Ahmed Rashid, writing in the Financial Times, stated that through the office Qatar has \"facilitated meetings between the Taliban and many countries and organisations, including the US state department, the UN, Japan, several European governments and non-governmental organisations, all of whom have been trying to push forward the idea of peace talks.\"[158] It played a major role in establishing the first ceasefire in the 2023 Israel-Hamas war and the concurrent initial hostage exchange. These high-risk diplomatic middle man endeavors (and its own rigorous defense stance) have thus earned it a reputation as \"a prickly Switzerland\".[159]In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen broke diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.[160] The crisis escalated a dispute over Qatar\\'s support of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is considered a terrorist organization by some Arab nations.[161] The diplomatic crisis ended in January 2021 with the signing of AlUla declaration.[162]\\nOn 2 October 2020, Qatari authorities strip-searched 13 Australian women on a plane at Hamad International Airport over a premature baby found in a bathroom at the terminal. This caused an international incident with Australia.[163][164] In September 2023, Qatar mediated the US- Iran prisoners swap deal. Iran freed five Americans in exchange for five Iranians held in the US and transfer $6 billion in frozen Iranian money from South Korea to Qatar.[165] In October 2023 United States President Joe Biden thanked to the Qatar\\'s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for his help in mediating a landmark prisoner swap deal with Iran.[166]\\nThe Qatar Armed Forces maintains a modest military force of approximately 11,800 men, including an army (8,500), navy (1,800) and air force (1,500). Qatar\\'s defense expenditures accounted for approximately 4.2% of gross national product in 1993, and 1.5% of GDP in 2010, the most recent year available in the SIPRI statistical database.[167] Qatar has recently signed defense pacts with the United States and United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. \\nThe presence of Al Udeid Air Base, operated by the United States and several other UN nations, provides a guaranteed source of defense and national security. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on military expenditures, 2.3% of the GDP.[168] Qatari special forces have been trained by France and other Western countries.[169] They helped the Libyan rebels during the 2011 Battle of Tripoli.[169]\\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that in 2010–14 Qatar was the 46th-largest arms importer in the world. SIPRI writes that Qatar\\'s plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated. Orders in 2013 for 62 tanks and 24 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 24 combat helicopters and 3 early-warning-and-control aircraft from the US, and 2 tanker aircraft from Spain.[170] In 2015, Qatar was the 16th largest arms importer in the world, and in 2016, it was the 11th largest, according to SIPRI.[171]\\nQatar\\'s human rights record has been regarded by academics and non-governmental organisations as being generally poor, with restrictions on civil liberties such as the freedoms of association, expression and the press, as well as its treatment of thousands of migrant workers amounting to forced labour for projects in the country.[172][173]\\nIn May 2012, Qatari officials declared their intention to allow the establishment of an independent trade union.[174] In 2014, Qatar commissioned international law firm DLA Piper to produce a report investigating the immigrant labour system. In May 2014, DLA Piper released more than 60 recommendations for reforming the kafala system including the abolition of exit visas and the introduction of a minimum wage, which Qatar has pledged to implement. Qatar also announced it would scrap its sponsor system for foreign labour, which requires that all foreign workers be sponsored by local employers.[175]\\nThe UN Committee Against Torture found that the provisions for flogging and stoning within the Qatari criminal code constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture.[176][177] Homosexual acts are illegal and can be punished by death.[178] However, there is no such evidence that the death penalty has been given for same-sex relations due to homosexuality act.[179]\\nUnder the provisions of Qatar\\'s sponsorship law, sponsors had the unilateral power to cancel workers\\' residency permits, deny workers\\' ability to change employers, report a worker as \"absconded\" to police authorities, and deny permission to leave the country.[180] As a result, sponsors may restrict workers\\' movements, and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights.[180] According to the ITUC, the visa sponsorship system allows the exaction of forced labour by making it difficult for a migrant worker to leave an abusive employer or travel overseas without permission.[181] Qatar also did not maintain wage standards for its immigrant labourers. Additional changes to labour laws include a provision guaranteeing that all workers\\' salaries are paid directly into their bank accounts and new restrictions on working outdoors in the hottest hours during the summer.[182]\\nIn 2016 laws were reformed to mandate that companies that fail to pay workers\\' wages on time could temporarily lose their ability to hire more employees.[183][184] Human Rights Watch claimed that the changes might fail to address some labour rights issues.[185][186] A minimum wage was instituted in 2021.[187] The country enfranchised women at the same time as men in connection with the 1999 elections for a Central Municipal Council.[110][188] These elections—the first-ever in Qatar—were intentionally held on 8 March 1999, International Women\\'s Day.[110]\\nQatar is divided into eight municipalities (Arabic: baladiyah).[189]\\nFor statistical purposes, the municipalities are further subdivided into 98 zones,[190] which are in turn subdivided into blocks.[191]\\nThe Qatari peninsula protrudes 160 kilometres (100\\xa0mi) into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia. It lies between latitudes 24° and 27° N, and longitudes 50° and 52° E. Most of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand. To the southeast lies the Khor al\\xa0Adaid (\"Inland Sea\"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Persian Gulf.\\nThe highest point is Qurayn Abu al Bawl at 103 metres (338\\xa0ft)[3] in the Jebel Dukhan to the west, a range of low limestone outcroppings running north–south from Zikrit through Umm Bab to the southern border. The Jebel Dukhan area also contains Qatar\\'s main onshore oil deposits, while the natural gas fields lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.[citation needed]\\nQatar became part of the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity in 1996.[194] It subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan in 2005.[195] A total of 142 fungal species have been recorded from Qatar.[196] A book recently produced by the Ministry of Environment documents the lizards known or believed to occur in Qatar, based on surveys conducted by an international team of scientists and other collaborators.[197]\\nAccording to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, carbon dioxide emissions per person average over 30 tonnes, one of the highest in the world.[198]\\nBefore the discovery of oil, the economy focused on fishing and pearl hunting. A report prepared by local governors of Ottoman Empire in 1892 states that income from pearl hunting in 1892 is 2,450,000 kran.[75] After the introduction of the Japanese cultured pearl onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar\\'s pearling industry crashed. Oil was discovered in Qatar in 1940, in Dukhan Field.[200] The discovery transformed the state\\'s economy. Now, the country has a high standard of living for its legal citizens. With no income tax, Qatar (along with Bahrain) is one of the countries with the lowest tax rates in the world. The unemployment rate in June 2013 was 0.1%.[201] Corporate law mandates that Qatari nationals must hold 51% of any venture in the emirate.[92] Trade and industry is overseen by the Ministry of Business and Trade.[202]\\nAs of 2016[update], Qatar has the fourth highest GDP per capita in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund.[203] It relies heavily on foreign labor to grow its economy, to the extent that migrant workers compose 86% of the population and 94% of the workforce.[204][205] Economic growth has been almost exclusively based on its petroleum and natural gas industries, which began in 1940.[206] Qatar is the leading exporter of liquefied natural gas.[169] In 2012, it was estimated that Qatar would invest over $120\\xa0billion in the energy sector in the next 10 years.[207] The country was a member state of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), having joined in 1961, and having left in January 2019.[208]\\nIn 2012, Qatar retained its title of richest country in the world (according to per capita income) for the third time in a row, having first overtaken Luxembourg in 2010. According to the study published by the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, the per capita GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) was $106,000 (QR387,000) in 2012, helping the country retain its ranking as the world\\'s wealthiest nation. Luxembourg came a distant second with nearly $80,000 and Singapore third with per capita income of about $61,000.The research put Qatar\\'s GDP at $182bn in 2012 and said it had climbed to an all-time high due to soaring gas exports and high oil prices. Its population stood at 1.8 million in 2012.  \\nEstablished in 2005, Qatar Investment Authority is the country\\'s sovereign wealth fund, specializing in foreign investment.[209] In 2012, with assets of $115bn, QIA was ranked 12th among the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world.[210] With billions of dollars in surpluses from the oil and gas industry, the Qatari government has directed investments into United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Qatar Holding is the international investment arm of QIA. Since 2009, Qatar Holding has received $30–40bn per year from the state. As of 2014[update], it has investments around the world in Valentino, Siemens, Printemps, Harrods, The Shard, Barclays Bank, Heathrow Airport, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Volkswagen Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Bank of America, Tiffany, Agricultural Bank of China, Sainsbury\\'s, BlackBerry,[211] and Santander Brasil.[212][213]\\nThe country has no taxes on non-companies,[214] but authorities have announced plans to levy taxes on junk food and luxury items. The taxes would be implemented on goods that harm the human body—for example, fast food, tobacco products, and soft drinks. The rollout of these initial taxes is believed to be the result of the fall in oil prices and a deficit that the country faced in 2016. Additionally, the country saw job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.[215][216]\\nAs of 2012[update], Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. The economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government\\'s spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.[citation needed]\\nQatar\\'s proven reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000\\xa0km3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas to Japan. \\nQatar\\'s heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned QatarEnergy. The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar\\'s oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.[217]\\nIn 2008 Qatar launched its National Vision 2030 which highlights environmental development as one of the four main goals for Qatar over the next two decades.[218] The National Vision pledges to develop sustainable alternatives to oil-based energy to preserve the local and global environment.[218] Qatar has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades. By 2030, Qatar has set the goal of attaining 20% of its energy from solar power.[219] The country is well-positioned to capitalize on photovoltaic systems, as it has a global horizontal irradiance value of approximately 2,140 kWh per square meter annually. Furthermore, the direct irradiance parameter is roughly 2,008 kWh per square meter annually, implying that it would be able to benefit from concentrated solar power as well.[220] Qatar Foundation has been active in helping the solar power goals. It established Qatar Solar, which, together with Qatar Development Bank and German company SolarWorld, embarked on a joint venture resulting in the creation of Qatar Solar Technologies (QSTec). In 2017, QSTec commissioned its polysillicon plant in Ras Laffan. This plant has a capacity of 1.1 MW of solar power.[219]\\nQatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"Qatarisation\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar\\'s strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.[217]\\nQatar is one of the fastest growing countries in the field of tourism. According to the World Tourism rankings, more than 2.3 million international tourists visited in 2017. Qatar has become one of the most open countries in the Middle East due to its recent visa facilitation improvements, including allowing nationals of 88 countries to enter visa-free and free-of charge.[221] Qatar was recently put in the top eight in market climate in the Middle East by the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Survey 2019 of the World Economic Forum.[222][223]\\nDoha is one of the fastest-growing hotel and hospitality markets in the world. The $220 billion spent on infrastructure since the successful World Cup bid of 2010 has helped boost the industry. Hotels have also been helped by the country’s geographic location. The tourism sector continues to witness a strong recovery with more than 729,000 international visitors in the first half of 2022, marking a 19% increase compared to the full year of 2021, and the aim is to raise tourism to 12% of GDP by 2030.[224][225]\\nThe nation is also on course to experience a major jump in athletic and corporate tourism with hosting world-class tournaments such as the 2030 Asian Games and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[226] Qatar National Airlines, as well as Hamad International Airport, provide travelers with one of the best transportation services in the world, and this has increased tourism in Qatar. Gulf News, a research center in Qatar, by examining the statistics of recent years and upcoming events, has predicted that this country will earn 11 billion and 900 million dollars from attracting foreign travelers by 2020, This is achieved with the reason for this upward trend is the increase in hospitality and attention to the country\\'s culture in Qatar.[227]\\nIn 2008 the public works authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority, the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.[citation needed]\\nThe road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. \\nHamad International Airport is located in Doha. In 2014, it replaced the former Doha International Airport as Qatar\\'s principal airport. In 2016, the airport was named the 50th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic, serving 37,283,987 passengers, a 20.2% increase from 2015.[citation needed] Qatar Airways is one of the largest airlines in the world that serves in six continents connecting more than 160 destinations every day. It has won Airline of the Year in 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019 and employs more than 46,000 people.[228][229]\\nQatar is increasingly activating its logistics and ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa.[citation needed] For this purpose, ports such as Hamad Port are rapidly expanded and investments are made in their technology.[citation needed] The country is historically and currently part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the North Sea.[230][231][232] Hamad Port is Qatar\\'s main seaport, located south of Doha in the Umm Al Houl area. Construction of the port began in 2010; it became operational in December 2016.[233] Capable of handling up to 7.8 million tonnes of products annually, the bulk of trade which passes through the port consists of food and building materials.[234] On the northern coast, Ras Laffan Port serves as the most extensive liquid natural gas export facility in the world.[235]\\nThe number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour. In early 2017, the population was 2.6 million, with foreigners making up a vast majority. Only 313,000 (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million were expatriates.[20]\\nThe combined number of South Asians (from the countries of the Indian subcontinent including Sri Lanka) represent over 1.5 million people (60%). Among these, Indians are the largest community, numbering 650,000 in 2017,[20] followed by 350,000 Nepalese, 280,000 Bangladeshis, 145,000 Sri Lankans, and 125,000 Pakistanis. The contingent of expatriates which are not of South Asian origin represent around 28% of Qatar\\'s population, of which the largest group is 260,000 Filipinos and 200,000 Egyptians, plus many other nationalities (including nationals of other Arab countries, Europeans, etc.).[20]\\nQatar\\'s first demographic records date back to 1892, conducted by Ottoman governors in the region. Based on this census, which includes only the residents in cities, the population in 1892 was 9,830.[75] At the time of the first census, held in 1970, the population was 111,133.[238] The 2010 census recorded the population at 1,699,435.[8] In January 2013, the Qatar Statistics Authority estimated the population at 1,903,447, of which 1,405,164 were males and 498,283 females.[239] The influx of male labourers has skewed the gender balance, and women are now just one-quarter of the population.\\nIslam is the predominant religion and is the state religion although not the only religion practiced in the country,[240] and the constitution guarantees freedom to practise any faith within \"moral\" bounds.[241] Most citizens belong to the Salafi Muslim movement of Wahhabism,[242][243][244] and 5–15% of Muslims follow Shia Islam with other Islamic sects being very small in number.[245] In 2010, Qatar\\'s population was 67.7% Muslim, 13.8% Christian, 13.8% Hindu, and 3.1% Buddhist; other religions and religiously unaffiliated people accounted for the remaining 1.6%.[246]\\nSharia is the main source of legislation according to the constitution.[121][122] Qatar\\'s interpretation of Sharia is said to be not as \"strict\" as neighboring Saudi Arabia[247] but not as \"liberal\" as Dubai.[248] The vision of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs is \"to build a contemporary Islamic society along with fostering the Sharee’ah and cultural heritage\".[249]\\nThe non-Muslim population is composed almost entirely of foreigners. Since 2008, Christians have been allowed to build churches on ground donated by the government,[250][251] Active churches include the Mar Thoma Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and the Anglican Church of the Epiphany.[252][253][254] There are also two Mormon wards[252][253][254] and a Bahá\\'í community.[255]\\nArabic is the official language, with Qatari Arabic the local dialect. Qatari Sign Language is the language of the deaf community. English is commonly used as a second language,[256] and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce, to the extent that steps are being taken to try to preserve Arabic from English\\'s encroachment.[257] English is particularly useful for communication with Qatar\\'s large expatriate community. In the medical community, and in situations such as the training of nurses to work in Qatar, English acts as a lingua franca.[258] Reflecting the multicultural make-up of the country, many other languages are also spoken, including Persian, Baluchi, Brahui, Hindi, Malayalam, Urdu, Pashto, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Nepali, Sinhalese, Bengali, Tagalog, Tulu and Indonesian.[259]\\nHealthcare standards are generally high. Qatari citizens are covered by a national health-insurance plan, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance.[260] Government healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014.[261] This was a $2.1 billion increase from 2010.[262] The premier healthcare provider is Hamad Medical Corporation, established by the government as a non-profit healthcare provider, which runs a network of hospitals, ambulance services, and a home healthcare service, all of which are accredited by the Joint Commission.[citation needed]\\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 2.2% of the country\\'s GDP; the highest in the Middle East.[263] In 2006, there were 23.12 physicians and 61.81 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.[264] The life expectancy at birth was 82.08 years in 2014, or 83.27 years for males and 77.95 years for females, rendering it the highest life expectancy in the Middle East.[265] Qatar has a low infant mortality rate of 7 in 100,000.[266]\\nIn 2006, there were 25 beds per 10,000 people, and 27.6 doctors and 73.8 nurses per 10,000 people.[267] In 2011, the number of beds decreased to 12 per 10,000 people, whereas the number of doctors increased to 28 per 10,000 people. While the country has one of the lowest proportions of hospital beds in the region, the availability of physicians is the highest in the GCC.[268]\\nThe culture of Qatar is similar to other countries in Eastern Arabia, being significantly influenced by Islam. Qatar National Day, hosted annually on 18 December, has had an important role in developing a sense of national identity.[269] It is observed in remembrance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani\\'s succession to the throne and his subsequent unification of the country\\'s various tribes.[270][271]\\nThe Doha Cultural Festival is one of the cultural activities carried out annually by the Qatari Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage, which began in 2002 with the aim of spreading Qatari culture inside and outside Qatar.[citation needed]\\nQatari officials, especially the Al Thani family and the sister of the Emir of Qatar, Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pay special attention to art.[272][273] Al-Mayassa leads the Qatar Museums Authority. The Museum of Islamic Art, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region.[274] This and several other Qatari museums, like the Arab Museum of Modern Art, fall under the Qatar Museums Authority,[275] which also sponsors artistic events abroad, such as major exhibitions by Takahashi Murakami in Versailles (2010) and Damien Hirst in London (2012).\\nQatar is the world\\'s biggest buyer in the art market by value.[276] The Qatari cultural sector is being developed to enable the country to reach world recognition to contribute to the development of a country that comes mainly from its resources from the gas industry.[277]\\nQatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century. Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression. Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar\\'s earliest written poetry. Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their Bedouin traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles.[278]\\nDue to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving formal education during the 1950s and other significant societal changes, 1970 witnessed the introduction of the first short story anthology, and in 1993 the first locally authored novels were published. Poetry, particularly the predominant nabati form, retained some importance but would soon be overshadowed by other literary types.[278] Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the modern literature movement on a similar magnitude to males.[279]\\nQatar\\'s media was classified as \"not free\" in the 2014 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House.[280] TV broadcasting was started in 1970.[281] Al Jazeera is a main television network headquartered in Doha. Al Jazeera initially launched in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel of the same name and has since expanded into a global network of several speciality TV\\xa0channels.\\nIt has been reported that journalists practice self-censorship, particularly in regards to the government and ruling family of Qatar.[282] Criticism of the government, emir, and ruling family in the media is illegal. According to article 46 of the press law \"The Emir of the state of Qatar shall not be criticised and no statement can be attributed to him unless under a written permission from the manager of his office.\"[283] Journalists are also subject to prosecution for insulting Islam.[280]\\nIn 2014, a Cybercrime Prevention Law was passed. The law is said to restrict press freedom and carries prison sentences and fines for broad reasons such as jeopardising local peace or publishing false news.[284] The Gulf Center for Human Rights has stated that the law is a threat to freedom of speech and has called for certain articles of the law to be revoked.[285]\\nPress media has undergone expansion in recent years. There are currently seven newspapers in circulation in Qatar, with four being published in Arabic and three being published in English.[286] There are also newspapers from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka with editions printed from Qatar.[citation needed]\\nIn regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Qatar is the highest-ranked Middle Eastern country in the World Economic Forum\\'s Network Readiness Index (NRI)—an indicator for determining the development level of a country\\'s information and communication technologies. Qatar ranked number 23 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013.[287]\\nThe music of Qatar is based on Bedouin poetry, song and dance. Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylised martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), tambourines and cymbals with small drums.[288] Other percussion instruments used in folk music include galahs (a tall clay jar) and tin drinking cups known as tus or tasat, usually used in conjunction with a tabl, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick.[289] String instruments, such as the oud and rebaba, are also commonly used.[288]\\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Qatar, both in terms of players and spectators.[290] Shortly after the Qatar Football Association became affiliated with FIFA in 1970, one of the country\\'s earliest international accolades came in 1981 when the Qatar national under-20 team\\'s emerged as runners-up to West Germany in that year\\'s edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship after being defeated 4–0 in the final. At the senior level, Qatar has played host to two editions of the AFC Asian Cup; the first coming being the 9th edition in 1988 and the second being the 15th edition held in 2011.[291] For the first time in the country\\'s history, the Qatar national football team won the AFC Asian Cup in the 2019 edition hosted in the UAE, beating Japan 3–1 in the final. They won all seven of their matches, conceding only a single goal throughout the tournament.[292]\\nOn 2 December 2010, Qatar won their bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, despite never previously qualifying for the FIFA World Cup Finals.[293] Local organisers built 7 new stadiums and expanded 1 existing stadium for this event.[294][295] Qatar\\'s winning bid for the 2022 World Cup was greeted enthusiastically in the Persian Gulf region as it was the first time a country in the Middle East had been selected to host the tournament. At the same time, the bid has been embroiled in much controversy, including allegations of bribery and interference in the investigation of the alleged bribery. European football associations have also objected to the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar for a variety of reasons, from the impact of warm temperatures on players\\' fitness, to the disruption it might cause in European domestic league calendars should the event be rescheduled to take place during winter.[296][297] In May 2014, Qatari football official Mohammed bin Hammam was accused of making payments totalling £3m to officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.[298][299] A FIFA inquiry into the bidding process in November 2014 cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing.[300][301]\\nThe Guardian, a British national daily newspaper, produced a short documentary named \"Abuse and exploitation of migrant workers preparing emirate for 2022\".[302] A 2014 investigation by The Guardian reports that migrant workers who have been constructing luxurious offices for the organisers of the 2022 World Cup have not been paid in over a year, and are now \"working illegally from cockroach-infested lodgings.\"[303] For 2014, Nepalese migrants involved in constructing infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup died at a rate of one every two days.[304] The Qatar 2022 organising committee have responded to various allegations by claiming that hosting the World Cup in Qatar would act as a \"catalyst for change\" in the region.[305] According to a February 2021 article in The Guardian, some 6,500 migrant construction workers have died.[306] However, the World Cup in Qatar has been the most expensive World Cup in history and has many modern technologies, and people have expressed their satisfaction with hosting Qatar.[307][failed verification]\\nQatar was estimated to host a football fanbase of 1.6 million for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, the construction work in country was expected to only take the available 37,000 hotel rooms to 70,000 by the end of 2021. In December 2019, the Qatari World Cup officials approached the organizers of the Glastonbury Festival in England and the Coachella Festival in the US, to plan huge desert campsites for thousands of football fans. The World Cup campsites on the outskirts were reported to have licensed bars, restaurants, entertainment and washing facilities. Moreover, two cruise ships were also reserved as temporary floating accommodations for nearly 40,000 people during the tournament.[308]\\nThough football is the most popular sport, other team sports have experienced considerable success at senior level. In 2015, the national handball team emerged as runners-up to France in the World Men\\'s Handball Championship as hosts, however the tournament was marred by numerous controversies regarding the host nation and its team.[309] Further, in 2014, Qatar won the world championship in men\\'s 3x3 basketball.[310]\\nCricket is popular amongst the South Asian diaspora in Qatar. Casual street cricket is the most popular format of the game, but the Qatar Cricket Association has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1999 and the men\\'s and women\\'s national teams both play regularly in ICC competitions. The primary cricket ground in Qatar is the West End Park International Cricket Stadium.[311]\\nBasketball is a developed sport amongst Asian people in Qatar. Qatar hosted the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship, 2013 FIBA Asia 3x3 Championship, 2014 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship and 2022 FIBA Under-16 Asian Championship.[citation needed] Qatar will host the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup making this become the first Arab country to host the FIBA Basketball World Cup.[312]\\nKhalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex in Doha hosted the WTA Tour Championships in women\\'s tennis between 2008 and 2010. Doha holds the WTA Premier tournament Qatar Ladies Open annually. Since 2002, Qatar has hosted the annual Tour of Qatar, a cycling race in six stages. Every February, riders are racing on the roads across Qatar\\'s flat land for six days. Each stage covers a distance of more than 100\\xa0km, though the time trial usually is a shorter distance. Tour of Qatar is organised by the Qatar Cycling Federation for professional riders in the category of Elite Men.[313]\\nThe Qatar Army Skydiving Team has several different skydiving disciplines placing among the top nations in the world. The Qatar National Parachute team performs annually during Qatar\\'s National Day and at other large events, such as the 2015 World Handball Championship.[314]\\nDoha four times was the host of the official FIVB Volleyball Men\\'s Club World Championship and three times host FIVB Volleyball Women\\'s Club World Championship. Doha also hosted the Asian Volleyball Championship once.[315]\\nQatar hired the RAND Corporation to reform its K–12 education system.[169] Through Qatar Foundation, the country has built Education City, a campus that hosts local branches of the Weill Cornell Medical College, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Northwestern\\'s Medill School of Journalism, Texas A&M\\'s School of Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts and other Western institutions.[169][316]\\nThe illiteracy rate was 3.1% for males and 4.2% for females in 2012, the lowest in the Arab-speaking world and 86th in the world.[317] Citizens are required to attend government-provided education from kindergarten through high school.[318] Qatar University, founded in 1973, is the country\\'s oldest and largest institution of higher education.[319][320]\\nIn November 2002, Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani created The Supreme Education Council.[321] The Council directs and controls education for all ages from the pre-school level through the university level, including the \"Education for a New Era\" initiative which was established to try to position Qatar as a leader in education reform.[322][323] According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are Qatar University (1,881st worldwide), Texas A&M University at Qatar (3,905th) and Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (6,855th).[324]\\nIn 2009, Qatar established the Qatar Science & Technology Park in Education City to link those universities with industry. Education City is also home to a fully accredited international Baccalaureate school, Qatar Academy. In addition, two Canadian institutions, the College of the North Atlantic (headquarters in Newfoundland and Labrador) and the University of Calgary, have inaugurated campuses in Doha. Other for-profit universities have also established campuses in the city.[325]\\nIn 2012, Qatar was ranked third from the bottom of the 65 OECD countries participating in the PISA test of mathematics, reading and skills for 15- and 16-year-olds, despite having the highest per capita income in the world.[326][327] Qatar was ranked 50th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 65th in 2019.[328][329][330]\\nAs part of its national development strategy, Qatar has outlined a 10-year strategic plan to improve the level of education.[331] The government has launched educational outreach programs, such as Al-Bairaq. Al-Bairaq was launched in 2010 aims to provide high school students with an opportunity to experience a research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials in Qatar University. The program encompasses the STEM fields and languages.[332]\\nLaunched in 2006 as part of an initiative of the Qatar Foundation, the Qatar National Research Fund was created with the intent of securing public funds for scientific research. The fund functions as a means to diversify its economy from a primarily oil and gas-based one to a knowledge-based economy.[333] The Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) was established by Qatar Foundation in March 2009 as an attempt to assist the country\\'s transition towards a knowledge economy.[334][335] With a seed capital of $800 million and initially hosting 21 organizations,[335] the QSTP became Qatar\\'s first free-trade zone.[336]\\n25°30′N 51°15′E\\ufeff / \\ufeff25.500°N 51.250°E\\ufeff / 25.500; 51.250\\n'),\n",

       " ('Hawkgirl',\n",
       "  'Hawkgirl is the name of several superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original Hawkgirl, Shiera Sanders Hall, was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940). Shayera Hol was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert, and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (March 1961). Kendra Saunders was created by writer David S. Goyer and artist Stephen Sadowski, and first appeared in JSA: Secret Files and Origins #1 (August 1999). One of DC\\'s earliest super-heroines, Hawkgirl has appeared in many of the company\\'s flagship team-up titles including Justice Society of America and Justice League of America.\\nSeveral incarnations of Hawkgirl have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkgirl work closely with a partner/romantic interest Hawkman.\\nSince DC\\'s continuity was rewritten in the 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths, Hawkgirl\\'s history has become muddled with several new versions of the character appearing throughout the years, some associated with ancient Egypt and some with the fictional planet Thanagar. These versions of the character have starred in several series of various durations.\\nShiera Sanders Hall, Shayera Hol, and Kendra Saunders have all been adapted into various media, including direct-to-video animated films, video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, The Flash, Arrow, Young Justice, DC Super Hero Girls and Legends of Tomorrow. In particular, Ciara Renée portrayed Saunders in the Arrowverse franchise while Isabela Merced will portray an unidentified Hawkgirl in the DC Universe (DCU) film Superman: Legacy (2025).\\nCreated by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, Shiera Sanders first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced Hawkman.[1] Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in All Star Comics #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by Sheldon Moldoff,[2] based on Neville\\'s Hawkman costume.\\nWith the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of Flash Comics in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the Flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with The Brave and the Bold #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl became married Thanagarian police officers from the planet Thanagar who come to Earth to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as Shayera Hol (phonetically identical to Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the Justice League in Justice League of America #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her name to Hawkwoman in the Hawkman backup feature of World\\'s Finest Comics #274.\\nWith the establishment of DC\\'s multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One.\\nFollowing the events of DC\\'s miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the Last Days of the Justice Society one-shot. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, Limbo, where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent Ragnarök from occurring on the Earth.\\nInitially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, DC reversed this decision and rebooted Hawkman continuity after the success of the Hawkworld miniseries. Originally, Hawkworld was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but after the series became a success, DC Comics made Hawkworld an ongoing series set in the present, with both heroes only recently appearing on Earth after the events in the Invasion! miniseries, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. Several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkgirl\\'s Justice League appearances then needed to be fixed, including their appearance in the Invasion! miniseries. All previous appearances by the Silver Age Hawkgirl in the Justice League were explained by the Golden Age Hawkgirl taking the Silver Age Hawkgirl\\'s place. However, Hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre-Hawkworld Justice League adventures during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was trapped in Limbo. To explain this continuity error, a new Hawkwoman, Sharon Parker, was created and retconned into the Justice League during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was in Limbo.\\nAfter the Hawkworld reboot, Hawkgirl (Hawkwoman) was now Shayera Thal and not married to Katar Hol, instead merely his police partner. In post-Hawkworld continuity, Shayera adopts the name Hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name Hawkgirl. The Golden Age Hawkgirl is eventually returned from Limbo, but during the Zero Hour miniseries she is merged with Katar Hol and Golden Age Hawkman into a new persona.\\nA new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl\\'s cousin, Speed Saunders. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly JSA series and later in the Hawkman monthly. In 2006, the ongoing Hawkman monthly series was retitled Hawkgirl starting with issue #50 as part of the \"One Year Later\" jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The Hawkgirl comic book series was finished with issue #66.\\nThe Golden Age Hawkgirl was Shiera Sanders Hall, the reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman.\\nKendra Saunders was a young Hispanic woman who took her own life. When Kendra\\'s soul left her body, that of her grandfather\\'s first cousin Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl entered it, making Kendra a walk-in. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer Speed Saunders, recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the \"new\" Hawkgirl.\\nHawkgirl owes her powers to a belt of Nth metal, a substance native to the planet Thanagar (once home of another pair of Hawk-heroes, Katar Hol and Hawkwoman). The metal is psycho-reactive, responding to its bearer\\'s thoughts and in its base form has a number of electromagnetic/gravitational properties. To the Hawks, it grants the power of flight, superhuman strength, super-acute vision, and an enhanced healing/regeneration ability.\\nAdditionally, she displays advanced hand-to-hand combat skills. Like Hawkman, she retains the knowledge of several lifetimes worth of fighting. Her preferred weapons are a spear or mace, but she has also been depicted using swords, axes, warhammers, shields, and other melee weapons. She possesses shooting skills from her times as the gunfighter, Cinnamon.\\nIn addition, the Nth metal knife which murdered Hawkgirl in her original incarnation as Chay-Ara had an unusual effect upon her soul and that of her lover Khufu (Hawkman). The pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries. While not a superhuman power per se, this propensity for reincarnation has allowed Hawkgirl to cheat death and return to active duty in her current incarnation.\\nLike all modern Thanagarians, Shayera Hol has a pair of wings growing from her back which allows her to fly. As a Thanagarian, she has considerable physical strength, endurance and durability.\\nAs a former member of the Thanagarian military, she had extensive training in tactics, military science, and personal combat skills. Additionally, her focus in espionage can make her a difficult opponent to track, and provides her with an advantage when tracking villains.\\nHawkgirl carries a mace made of Nth metal, which can generate electric currents and repel magical energies, her mace is highly effective against magic, as shown when Hawkgirl defeated Doctor Fate, a powerful magician of the DC Universe. Hawkgirl is skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately. She has creatively used the mace as a shield to deflect incoming projectiles as well as a makeshift defibrillator unit.\\nHawkgirl is fluent in many Earth languages, through the use of the Absorbascon. Her unique Thanagarian physiology also enables her to verbally communicate with birds.[3]\\nThe Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.[4]\\nRecently, Kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing, strength, vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing Nth metal. She speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance. It remains to be seen if she still possesses these abilities now that she is Shiera Hall once again.[5]\\nIn the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Hawkgirl joined with the Amazons\\' Furies.[6] Later, Hawkgirl is seen aiding Artemis in her attempt to kill the Resistance movement member, Lois Lane.[7] Although, Lois is rescued by Resistance member Penny Black using the smoke grenades, Penny is seriously wounded. Later, when the Furies attack Grifter and the Resistance, Hawkgirl pins Grifter down, but he pulls Hawkgirl down and then stabs her chest with a trench knife.[8]\\nIn the DC Bombshells continuity set in World War II, Shiera is a technological genius and archaeologist who aids the Bombshells with her lover, Vixen. As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when Cheetah forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace.\\nShiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.\\nIntrigued, Shiera went to Zambesi to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met Queen Mari of Zambesi and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies.\\nHawkgirl discovered her true Thanagarian origins while fighting against Baroness Paula von Gunther. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it was revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the Wingmen of Thanagar, they sought to warn the humans of the intentions of Thanagar who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.[9]\\nShayera and Katar are featured in the Elseworlds three-part series Legend of the Hawkman (2000). The story takes place in the Earth-One timeline, some time after The Brave and the Bold #34. She is shown wanting to return home to Thanagar while Katar has grown accustomed to life on Earth. Although this mini-series was never labelled as an Elseworlds project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths era.\\nHawkgirl (Shayera Hol) and Hawkman feature in this mini-series set soon after their arrival on Earth as the duo faces an ancient menace with connections to their Thanagarian heritage. In the first chapter, \"The Fallen One\", Shayera has been anxious to return to Thanagar, but Katar feels a responsibility to the museum, especially its upcoming extraterrestrial treasure exhibit. While Katar has adopted Earth as his home Shayera doesn\\'t feel like they belong there. In Tibet a group of archaeologists discovers a Thanagarian gateway carved into a cliff side, after being informed of this Hawkgirl and Hawkman travel to the location.[10]\\nHawkman deciphers the writing on the gateway and it depicts the life of Thasaro, a Thanagarian child so evil that he threatened the existence of Thanagar\\'s ancient gods. The ancient gods of Aerie condemned Thasaro into a mystic urn. Shayera\\'s ancestor was entrusted with burying the urn so no one could release Thasaro. The archeologists and Katar want to examine the gateway but Shayera insists that the gateway be left alone. Hawkman and Shayera get into a fight until Shayera flies away heartbroken because Katar cares more about archeology than her feelings. Katar\\'s fingerprints genetically open the gateway. Shayera hears an explosion and heads back to the site. Thasaro appears and makes the stone sentries throughout his chamber come to life. The sentries attack Hawkgirl but she manages to defeat his enforcers and finds Katar within Thasaro\\'s grip. Thasaro then summons corpses like talons that rise up from the ground and pull Hawkgirl into a cavern beneath Thasaro\\'s chamber. The talons maim Hawkgirl, but she manages to break away. Shayera\\'s distress in the cavern awakens the spirit of her ancestor. Shayera\\'s ancestor channels his aura into Shayera and gives her the edge she needs to subdue Thasaro. Thasaro is banished once again into the urn. The urn is then transported to the Midway City Museum so Katar and Shayera can safeguard it.[11] Three months later Shayera is shown wanting to start a family, in the meantime Thanagarian zealots return to Earth to free the heinous fallen god. Thasaro\\'s return brings chaos and devastation to Midway City, but using their Nth Metal weapons Hawkgirl and Hawkman are able to subdue him, banishing him to the fiery depths of Earth\\'s Hell.[12]\\nIn JLA: The Nail and JLA: Another Nail, Hawkgirl is a member of a Justice League, and remains so even after her husband\\'s death by Amazo, although the team faces anti-alien prejudice and suspicion. She briefly contemplates abandoning Earth when anti-alien propaganda leads to a museum exhibit dedicated to Hawkman being vandalized, but when she returns to save two children from a burning building, her faith in humanity is restored when a group of civilians stand between her and government officials attempting to bring her in as an alien, the family she saved affirming that they still see Hawkman and her as heroes. In Another Nail, she appears to be close friends with Zatanna. She has forgiven Oliver Queen (in Amazo\\'s body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed, Queen believing that his attempts to prove himself caused Hawkman to put himself in danger to protect the more vulnerable Oliver. Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the Justice League animated series.\\nIn Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, the Hawks tried to return to Thanagar to flee from Lex Luthor\\'s military dictatorship, only to crash in the rain forests of Costa Rica. They decided to remain in hiding. They gave birth to a son and daughter, giving them natural wings. Katar and Shayera were killed in a military strike ordered by Lex Luthor, embracing each other in their final moments. The children were brought up in the jungle ever since. They were bent on revenge against Lex.[13] As Hawkboy, the son ultimately kills Lex with Batman\\'s permission, since he understands what he has been through.\\nIn Alex Ross\\'s Silver Age-toned Justice, Hawkgirl is a member of the Justice League and co-director of the Midway City Museum, alongside her husband. With the entire JLA\\'s secrets and weaknesses in hand, the Legion of Doom stages a simultaneous attack on nearly every member of the League. Hawkgirl and Hawkman are surprised by Toyman in the Midway City Museum, but manage to survive and decide to investigate his warehouse, where they are assaulted by his forces, and discover that he is making multiple Brainiac androids. She also appears in Secret Origins and Liberty and Justice.\\nKendra Saunders\\'s version of Hawkgirl is featured in Gotham City Garage series. She is the youngest member of a very old team. It\\'s revealed that Kendra\\'s parents were killed during an alien invasion, she was later rescued by the Blackhawks and trained from a young age with captain Blackhawk. She is shown using the Lady Blackhawk costume and the alias Kendra Blackhawk. She resigns from the Blackhawks to help the Gotham City Garage against Lex Luthor\\'s attacks.[14]\\nHawkgirl was chosen for one of the seven features in the one-shot comic book. She lives in Chicago, working as a police detective. She is from Thanagar, her mace vibrates like a smartphone when Nth-Metal Thanagarian weapons are near and she has a secret Hawkroom. It is revealed that she did not leave Thanagar on good terms. After some time collecting Thanagarian weapons from crime scenes, she started suspecting something was wrong. This led to her fighting against an ancient Thanagarian that wanted her dead since she chose humans instead of Thanagarians.\\nErica Schultz, said she was inspired by the DC Animated Universe version of the character: \"I\\'ve always been drawn to strong characters, but what really solidified my love for Shayera was the Justice League cartoon show.\"[15]\\nDuring a crossover with the cast of Scooby-Doo, the Silver Age version of Hawkgirl is featured alongside Hawkman in the Midway City Museum, working as curators. The heroes team-up with the characters from the animated series to discover who stole from their workplace. Later they uncover that Shadow Thief, Matter Master and Fadeaway Man were behind it. After a fight against the villains the heroes retrieve the stolen items.\\nHawkgirl appears as Shiera Hall in the continuation series to DC Comics Bombshells, Bombshells: United set in the United States in 1943. Shiera is shown in Zambesi alongside her lover, Vixen.[16] Hawkgirl is later featured fighting against the Apokolips invasion on Earth.[17]\\nIGN\\'s list of the \"Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics\" ranked Hawkgirl as #22.[27] She was ranked 80th in Comics Buyer\\'s Guide\\'s \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.[28]\\n'),\n",

       "  'The Chain of Chance (original Polish title: Katar, literally, \"Rhinitis\"/Catarrh) is a science fiction/detective novel by the Polish writer Stanisław Lem, published in 1976. Lem\\'s treatment of the detective genre introduces many nontraditional elements. The reader is prompted not only to consider various suspects as possible culprits in a series of murders, but also the possibility that they have all happened purely by chance (hence the English title). In this way, the natural laws of probability and chaos theory play the role of suspects and characters in a murder mystery, lending elements of science fiction to the novel. The underlying philosophical idea is exploited by Lem in his major essay The Philosophy of Chance.\\nA former astronaut is hired by a detective agency to help in an investigation of a case of mysterious deaths. Several victims became mad and committed suicide during their vacation in various Naples spas, apparently without reason. Due to certain similarities in the circumstances of the deaths and the profiles of the victims the case is assumed to be a serial murder by poisoning, although it is never certain what (if any) real connection exists between the victims.\\nDuring the investigation, it becomes apparent that certain innocent chemicals can be combined into a strong depressor, a kind of chemical weapon. The hero experiences its effects, but his training helps him to survive and solve the case. He discovers the industrial sources of the chemicals, and demonstrates how random chance chemical reactions led to the string of deaths.\\nOne of chemical compounds involved in the deadly mixture comes from an anti-allergic drug, which the hero takes for allergic rhinitis, hence the novel\\'s original title.\\nComparing to Lem\\'s other mystery novel, The Investigation, Lem himself notes that the latter one is rather overstretched, while the story in Katar is more credible.[1]\\nIn 1979 the novel (translated as Le Rhume in French) received the French literary prize Grand Prix de Littérature Policière  in the International category.[2][3]\\nIn 1998 it was translated in Romanian as Catarul by Mihai Mitu and published by Editura Nemira\\xa0[ro].[4][5]\\nIn 2020 it was translated in Italian as Febbre da fieno translated by Lorenzo Pompeo\\xa0[it],[6]\\nThis article about a crime novel of the 1970s is a stub.

       " ('Shayera Hol',\n",
       "  'Shayera Thal, later married with the name Shayera Hol, is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books during the Silver Age of Comics published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert, and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (March 1961). She is the second Hawkgirl and first Hawkwoman.\\nThe character has since appeared in various media following her inception in the comics, most notably in the DC Animated Universe voiced by Maria Canals-Barrera.\\nWith the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of Flash Comics in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the Flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with The Brave and the Bold #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl were married alien police officers from the planet Thanagar who came to Earth to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as Shayera (phonetically identical to first Shierra, then Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the Justice League in Justice League of America #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. Many years later, Silver Age Hawkgirl joined the Justice League of America with issue #146 in 1977. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her code name to Hawkwoman in the Hawkman backup feature of World\\'s Finest Comics #272.\\nWith the establishment of DC\\'s multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One.\\nShayera Thal, the Silver Age version of Hawkgirl / Hawkwoman, was a law enforcement officer from the planet Thanagar and wife of Katar Hol, the Silver Age Hawkman and was a member of the Justice League of America.\\nShe was born and raised on Thanagar, which had a scientifically advanced civilization in which crime was virtually unknown. As an adolescent, Shayera Thal[1] joined the Thanagarian police force and was assigned to assist the force\\'s most decorated officer, Katar Hol, in capturing the Dragonfly Robbers. She introduces herself as \"Policewoman Shayera Thal\".[2]  At first, Katar was furious at being assigned to an inexperienced young woman as a partner, but he nevertheless became strongly attracted to her.\\nTogether, they captured the Dragonfly Robbers in their stronghold found behind a waterfall; while on the case, Shayera saved Katar\\'s life and the two fell deeply in love. A few weeks later, Katar proposed to Shayera in front of the same waterfall. She accepted and they were married. Ten years later, the couple was sent to Earth in pursuit of the criminal Byth Rok. Upon reaching Earth, they were befriended by Midway City police commissioner George Emmett, who established cover identities for them as Carter and Shiera Hall. After capturing Byth and bringing him back to their planet, Katar and Shayera chose to return to study Earth\\'s crimefighting methods, and they fought against evil as the superheroes Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Shayera renamed herself Hawkwoman in the early 1980s.\\nAs Hawkwoman, Shayera eventually joined her husband as a member of the Justice League. She was the first League member admitted as part of the League\\'s vote to lift its prior twelve-member limitation.[3] Her membership set precedent for the admission of Zatanna as the League\\'s fifteenth member. Both Zatanna and Shayera became close friends since Hawkman vol. 2 #4.\\nAs Shiera, she first worked as Carter\\'s secretary, but later became co-director of the Midway City Museum. She has a sort of rivalry with the museum naturalist Mavis Trent who has her eyes on both Hawkman and Carter Hall.\\nLater, Thanagar had established itself as a military dictatorship bent on conquering other planets. Hawkman and Hawkwoman thwarted Thanagarian plans to invade Earth, destroying their own starship in the process. Hawkman and Hawkwoman remain on Earth, regarded as traitors by everyone on Thanagar. She helped her husband come to terms with the deaths they caused during the battle. Eventually, she changed her codename to Hawkwoman.[4]\\nFollowing the events of DC\\'s miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the histories of Earth-One and Earth-Two are merged. As a result, both Golden Age and Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl/Hawkwoman live on the same Earth. Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged. They took Superman to Krypton (now a gas planet),[5] briefly joined Justice League International, teamed-up with Atom,[6] and helped Animal Man defuse a Thanagarian bomb during Invasion. However, DC reversed this decision and rebooted Hawkman continuity after the success of the 1989 Hawkworld miniseries. Originally, Hawkworld retold the origins of Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. After becoming a success, DC Comics launched a Hawkworld ongoing series set in the present resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. By doing so, several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkwoman\\'s Justice League appearances needed to be fixed.\\nFollowing the Convergence storyline, Shayera Thal is featured in the Hawkman: Convergence. She is shown working as a curator in Gotham City museum while fighting as Hawkwoman also. At the end of the story her universe vanishes due to the Crisis happening, she is last seen flying with Hawkman.\\nFollowing Rebirth\\'s continuity, Shayera Hol appeared in the Hawkman (vol. 5) series. She was shown in Thanagar alongside her partner Katar Hol. Later, Shayera appeared in the Justice League (vol. 2) issues #14-16 where she was shown as the empress of Thanagar Prime. Initially presenting herself as a friend and ally to the Justice League, she was revealed to be hiding many secrets from them, including a surviving Martian elder known as the Keep. It is revealed that Shayera used a device known as the Absorbacon and the Martian elder to create a fake construct of a restored Thanagar Prime, her people, and Katar Hol (the Savage Hawkman). After the death of the Martian elder, Shayera tries to keep her constructed reality from fading away but is unable to, saying goodbye to Katar one last time. It is revealed by Starman that the reason Shayera still exists despite being Kendra Saunders\\' immediate predecessor in their chain of resurrection is due to the Totality breaking said chain and splitting the two, making Shayera a completely independent being from Kendra. This was done by Perpetua as she feared what would happen if a whole Hawkgirl faced her at the end. Shayera assists the Justice League in their failed attempt to heal the Source Wall.[7]\\nShayera reappears in Justice League (vol. 2) #32, shown aboard a Thanagarian ship, trying to prevent Lex Luthor from reaching the Anti-Monitor.[8]\\nShayera came back to Earth to help Carter Hall, who was infected by The Batman Who Laughs. As of that issue, Hawkwoman started acting as co-protagonist of the book alongside Hawkman.[9]\\nShayera is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Herald Shrra, a being akin to a biblical angel. She served an unnamed deity which had deemed the universe unworthy and condemned it to be destroyed by the Lord Beyond the Void. She sensed something that was good in Ktar Deathbringer, the original incarnation of Hawkman, and intervened in the deity\\'s plans by appearing before Ktar in the aftermath of each battle, pushing him by guilt and shame to turn on the Lord Beyond the Void. As Ktar had made a bargain with the deity to reincarnate until he had saved as many people as he had killed, it punished Shrra for her defiance by stripping her of her divinity and condemning her to share his fate.\\nHawkwoman teams up with Carter\\'s old friends the Atom and Adam Strange to capture and cure Carter of his infection. They catch up to Sky Tyrant on an alien world where one of his previous incarnations named Titan Hawk had hidden an artifact known as \"The Key\" which would have released the Lord Beyond the Void. They recover the Key and imprison Sky Tyrant on Carter\\'s starship. When she touches the Key, her memories of all her past lives are unlocked. Sky Tyrant manages to escape his cell and brawls with the three heroes, he and Shayera touch the Key together and are transported to the realm of the Lord Beyond the Void. In the process, Carter is cured of his infection (all infected heroes were cured by Lex Luthor in the Year of the Villain: Hell Arisen oneshot). The pair are attacked by Deathbringers who recognise Carter as Ktar, and, although the Deathbringers are defeated, they draw the attention of the Lord Beyond the Void.\\nThe Lord easily overpowers them and binds them to a great stone monolith, planning to absorb the energy from all their lives, which will give him sufficient power to cross over into the universe. Carter and Shayera release the power of their thousands of lives, overloading and destroying the Lord, while also killing themselves. They awake in the afterlife, reverted to Ktar and Shrra. The deity explains that Ktar\\'s debt is repaid, and offers to allow him to pass on and to restore Shrra as a Herald, however, the two do not wish to be parted. Therefore, the deity offers them another reward, to be reincarnated a final time in their favourite lives, where they will be extremely long lived but mortal. The two agree and are restored to life in the 1940s as the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl and reunite with their old friends in the Justice Society of America.\\nDuring a fight with the Injustice Society, Carter freezes with fear at a moment when the villains have the upper hand. Shayera throws her mace into Carter\\'s, creating an explosion which incapacitates the Injustice Society and turns the tide of the fight. The JSA assumes Carter was simply providing a distraction for Shayera, but he privately admits to her that now he is mortal, he fears dying. Meanwhile, Anton Hastor, an incarnation of the Hawks\\' ancient enemy Hath-Set, learns that Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara have been reincarnated, and this time, they can be killed permanently. Hastor steals his Nth Metal dagger from JSA headquarters and draws the Hawks out to a train where he has killed the passengers and resurrected them as zombies. Shayera is tackled off the train by zombies while Hastor attacks Carter, who is too fearful to fight back until Hastor threatens Shayera. Carter disarms Hastor by stabbing himself with the dagger just as Shayera catches up to the train and destroys the dagger. Shayera spends the following centuries as a hero alongside Carter, surviving into the 40th Century.[10]\\nShayera appeared as a member of the Justice Society of America in the Dark Crisis event.[11]\\nShayera and Katar are featured in the Elseworlds three-part series Legend of the Hawkman (2000).

       "  '\\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar\\'s hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host\\'s national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina\\'s third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament\\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as the greatest player of all time.[4] Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament\\'s best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament\\'s best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.\\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country\\'s treatment of migrant workers, women, and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar\\'s climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[D]\\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA.[13][14] The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[15] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[15] The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]\\nUnlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar\\'s intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]\\nThe match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30][31] The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[28][32]\\nThe matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[32]\\nFIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[33][34]\\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5\\xa0million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9\\xa0million in prize money. This edition\\'s total prize pool was $440\\xa0million, $40\\xa0million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35]\\nThe tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[36][37][38] In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team\\'s quota of regular substitutions.[39] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country\\'s opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[40]\\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia\\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[44]\\nAfter UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[45] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.\\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[46] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[47] The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having \"high operational risk\",[48] generated criticism from media commentators.[49] It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals,[50] which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.\\nThe voting patterns were as follows:[51]\\nAt an estimated cost of over $220\\xa0billion,[52] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8\\xa0billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.[53]\\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability.[54] The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20\\xa0°C (36\\xa0°F).[55][56]\\nTheir marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[55][56] Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.[57] The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.[58]\\nIn an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.[59] Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.[60] By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years\\' time. Qatar\\'s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.[61][62]\\nOf these eight stadiums, all but one have since been either dismantled, or have been moderately or heavily modified. The Stadium 974 is no longer in use and is slated for dismantled after the tournament—this stadium was the first temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup.[63] Lusail Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium and Al Janoub Stadium will been moderately or heavily modified as reduce their capacity by half.[64] The Khalifa International Stadium is the only largely unmodified stadium that was used for this tournament.\\n\\nTeam base camps \\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team.[81][82] This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[83][84]\\nThe Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.[85] The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel,[85] whilst Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.[86]\\nFIFA\\'s six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[87] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[88] France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.[89]\\nSaint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic.[90] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha\\'apai eruption and tsunami.[91] Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.[92][93]\\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018.[94] Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986.[95] Wales made their first appearance in 64 years—the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.[96]\\nItaly, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals.[97] The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men\\'s World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006.[98] The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[99]\\nChile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa América winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament.[100] Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.[101]\\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men\\'s World Ranking before the tournament were:[102]\\nAFC (6)\\nCAF (5)\\nCONCACAF (4)\\nCONMEBOL (4)\\nOFC (0)\\nUEFA (13)\\n\\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[103] Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[104] In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition.[105] All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.[106][107]\\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar,[108] on 1 April 2022,[109] 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw.[110] The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matthäus (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinović (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).[111][112]\\nFor the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men\\'s World Rankings of 31 March 2022.[113] Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.[114]\\nThis principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.[114] The pots for the draw are shown below.[115]\\nIn May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.[117][118]\\nFor the first time women referees officiated games at a major men\\'s tournament.[119] France\\'s Stéphanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men\\'s World Cup.[120] Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women\\'s World Cup Final.[121] They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.[122]\\nGambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final.[123][124][125] Other returning officials included referees César Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.[126][127][128]\\nOn 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.[129]\\nThe opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador.[130] It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi.[131][132] It was the first time that the Qur\\'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony.[133]\\nThe group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December.[134] Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.\\nThe first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes,[136] but eventually won 2–0 with two goals from Enner Valencia.[137] Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.[138][139][140] Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left.[141][142] The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2–0 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time.[143] Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1–0 ahead. Famara Diédhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar\\'s first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3–1 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.[144] Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.[145] The Netherlands won 2–0 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches.[146] Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Ismaïla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, Moisés Caicedo scored an equaliser, but shortly after, Kalidou Koulibaly gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.[147]\\nEngland completed a 6–2 victory over Iran. Iranian keeper Alireza Beiranvand was removed from the game for a suspected concussion before England scored three first-half goals.[148] Mehdi Taremi scored in the second half after which England defender Harry Maguire was also removed for a concussion.[148] Timothy Weah, of the United States, scored a first-half goal against Wales; however, the match finished as a draw after a penalty kick was won and scored by Gareth Bale.[149] Iran defeated Wales 2–0 following a red card to Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey after he committed a foul outside of his penalty area. Substitute Rouzbeh Cheshmi scored the first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by Ramin Rezaeian scoring three minutes later.[150] England and the United States played to a 0–0 draw, with only four shots on target between them, and one shot from Christian Pulisic hit the crossbar.[151] England won the group following a 3–0 win over Wales with a goal by Phil Foden and two by Marcus Rashford.[152] Christian Pulisic scored the winning goal as the United States defeated Iran 1–0 to qualify for the round of 16.[153]\\nArgentina took an early lead against Saudi Arabia after Lionel Messi scored a penalty kick after ten minutes; however, second-half goals by Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari won the match 2–1 for Saudi Arabia,[154] a result the media considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of the event.[155][156] The match between Mexico and Poland ended as a goalless 0–0 draw after Guillermo Ochoa saved Robert Lewandowski\\'s penalty kick attempt.[157] Lewandowski scored his first career World Cup goal in a 2–0 win over Saudi Arabia four days later.[158][159] Argentina defeated Mexico 2–0, with Messi scoring the opener and later assisting teammate Enzo Fernández who scored his first international goal.[160][161] Argentina won their last game against Poland with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez, which was enough to win the group;[162] Poland qualified for the knockout stage on goal difference, thanks to Saudi Arabia scoring an injury-time consolation goal against Mexico in a match already lost.[163]\\nThe match between Denmark and Tunisia ended as a goalless draw; both teams had goals disallowed by offside calls.[164] Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen made his first major international appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest at the UEFA Euro 2020.[164] Defending champions France went a goal behind to Australia, after a Craig Goodwin goal within ten minutes. France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappé and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4–1.[165] The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France\\'s all-time top goalscorer.[165] Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010.[166][167] Mbappé scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2–1. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round—the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round.[166][168] Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1–0, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win.[169] Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.[170]\\nGroup E began with Japan facing 2014 champions Germany. After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany\\'s İlkay Gündoğan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu Dōan and Takuma Asano in a 2–1 win.[171] In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7–0. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres.[172][173] This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal\\'s victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline.[174] Costa Rica defeated Japan 1–0, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica\\'s first shot on target of the tournament.[175] Germany and Spain drew 1–1, with Álvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas Füllkrug scoring for Germany.[176][177][178] Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match.[179] Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play. The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2–1 win.[179] Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2–1 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals—two by Kai Havertz and a goal by Niclas Fullkrug, ending in a 4–2 win for Germany—which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages.[180] Japan won the group ahead of Spain.[181]\\nGroup F\\'s first match was a goalless draw between Morocco and Croatia.[182] Canada had a penalty kick in the first half of their match against Belgium which was saved by Thibaut Courtois. Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi.[183][184] Belgium lost 2–0 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Saïss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998.[185][186] The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents.[187] Alphonso Davies scored Canada\\'s first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramarić for Croatia completed a 4–1 victory.[188] Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2–1 victory. Canada\\'s only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd.[189] Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.[190]\\nBreel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland\\'s 1–0 defeat of Cameroon.[191] Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury.[192] Cameroon\\'s Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlović, Sergej Milinković-Savić, and Aleksandar Mitrović either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3–3 draw.[193] An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage.[194] Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1–0 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal.[195] Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3–2.[196]\\nUruguay and South Korea played to a goalless draw.[197] A goalless first half between Portugal and Ghana preceded a penalty converted by Cristiano Ronaldo to give Portugal the lead. In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by André Ayew before goals by João Félix, and Rafael Leão by Portugal put them 3–1 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while Iñaki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3–2 to Portugal.[198] Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3–2 for Ghana.[199] Portugal defeated Uruguay 2–0 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage.[200] A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from José María Giménez.[201][202] Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2–1 for South Korea.[203] Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2–0.[204] However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored.[205] Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.[206][207][208]\\nIn the knockout stage, if the scores were equal when normal playing time expired, extra time was played for two periods of 15 minutes each. This was followed, if required, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.[135]\\nThe round of 16 was played from 3 to 7 December,[32] which for the first time ever included teams from the Americas and four other continents.[209] Group A winners Netherlands scored goals through Memphis Depay, Daley Blind, and Denzel Dumfries as they defeated the United States 3–1, with Haji Wright scoring for the United States.[210] Messi scored his third of the tournament alongside Julián Álvarez to give Argentina a two-goal lead over Australia, and despite an Enzo Fernández own goal from a Craig Goodwin shot, Argentina won 2–1.[211] Olivier Giroud\\'s goal and Mbappé\\'s brace enabled France to have a 3–1 victory over Poland, with Robert Lewandowski scoring the lone goal for Poland from a penalty.[212] England beat Senegal 3–0, with goals coming from Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka.[213] Daizen Maeda scored for Japan against Croatia in the first half before a leveller from Ivan Perišić in the second. Neither team could find the winner, with Croatia defeating Japan 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out.[214] Vinícius Júnior, Neymar, Richarlison, and Lucas Paquetá all scored for Brazil, but a volley from South Korean Paik Seung-ho reduced the deficit to 4–1.[215] Pablo Sarabia had the best chance for Spain to break the deadlock against Morocco in stoppage time after two goalless hours, but he hit the goalie\\'s right-hand post after a shot from the left; Morocco won the match 3–0 on penalties.[216] A hat-trick by Gonçalo Ramos led Portugal to defeat Switzerland 6–1, with goals from Portugal\\'s Pepe, Raphaël Guerreiro, and Rafael Leão and from Switzerland\\'s Manuel Akanji.[217]\\nThe quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December.[32] Croatia and Brazil ended 0–0 after 90 minutes and went to extra time. Neymar scored for Brazil in the 15th minute of extra time. Croatia, however, equalised through Bruno Petković in the second period of extra time. With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4–2.[218][219] In the second quarter-final match, Nahuel Molina and Messi scored for Argentina before Wout Weghorst equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4–3.[220] Morocco defeated Portugal 1–0, with Youssef En-Nesyri scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition.[221] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2–1 by virtue of goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[222][223]\\nThe semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December.[32] Messi scored a penalty kick before Julián Álvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3–0 victory over Croatia.[224] Théo Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2–0 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.[225]\\nThe third place play-off was played on 17 December. The two teams had played against each other in their opening game in Group F which finished 0–0. Joško Gvardiol promptly scored for Croatia, with Achraf Dari equalising just 2 minutes later. Mislav Oršić scored the winner for Croatia as the match finished 2–1.[226] Morocco earned 4th place, a record for the team and the best World Cup finish of any African or Arab nation.[227]\\nThe final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams had won the event twice previously.[228] Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[228][229] Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[229] With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[229] With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2.[229] This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.[229]\\nThere were 172 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.69 goals per match.\\nThis was the most goals scored at a World Cup.[230]\\n8 goals\\n7 goals\\n4 goals\\n3 goals\\n2 goals\\n1 goal\\n1 own goal\\nA player or team official is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:[135]\\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper).[236]\\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\\'s best. The award was won by Brazil\\'s Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.[237]\\nThe official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands[238] and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It is based on a shawl (reflecting upon the tournament\\'s late-Autumn scheduling) and desert dunes, and was shaped to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number \"8\"—reflecting upon the \"interconnected\" event and the eight host stadiums. The typography of the emblem\\'s wordmark incorporated kashida—the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.[239][240][241]\\nH.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to \"promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment\", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its \"commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.\"[242]\\nElectronic Arts\\' licensed video games FIFA Mobile and FIFA 23 (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for FIFA 23 added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.[243]\\nOn 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.[244]\\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.[245]\\nIn May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5\\xa0billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57\\xa0billion across the tournament.[246] The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage.[247][248] The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7\\xa0million).[249][250]\\nThe tournament\\'s official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is Laʼeeb (Arabic: لعيب, romanized:\\xa0Laʿīb), which is an Arabic word meaning \"super-skilled player\". The official website of FIFA says: \"Laʼeeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes\", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, \"a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone\".[282]\\nThe official match ball, \"Al Rihla\", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word Al-Rihla (الْرِّحْلَة ar-riḥla) means \"the journey\". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As \"the game is getting faster\" and \"speeds up\", the Adidas ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second[283] and it has to be charged before each game.[284] Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.[285]\\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the Adidas Al Hilm (Arabic: الحلم, romanized:\\xa0al-ḥulm, lit.\\u2009\\'the dream\\', a reference to \"every nation\\'s dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup\").[286] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design,[287] a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final\\'s venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[288]\\nFor the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song.[289] The first song of the album is \"Hayya Hayya (Better Together)\", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video.[290] The second song is \"Arhbo\", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video.[291] The third song is \"The World Is Yours to Take\" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video.[292] The fourth song is \"Light The Sky\" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.[293]\\nA fifth song, \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival.[294] The final song is \"Dreamers\" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament\\'s opening ceremony.[295][296]\\nCriticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar\\'s human-rights record,[297] namely their treatment of migrant workers,[297] women, and position on LGBT rights,[298] leading to allegations of sportswashing.[P] Others cited Qatar\\'s climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[6][302] Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[300][301] with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\".[303][304] The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[305] In June 2023, Le Point revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by Arcom, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.[306]\\nThere have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA\\'s executive committee members.[307] These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see §\\xa0Bidding corruption allegations, 2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA\\'s report on his enquiry as containing \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"[308]\\nIn May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.[309][310] In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used \"black ops\", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.[311] Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.[312]\\nIn September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA\\'s president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.[313]\\nQatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to \"forced labour\" and poor working conditions,[314][315] while many migrant workers reported having to pay large \"recruitment fees\" to obtain employment.[316] The Guardian newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. The Guardian estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers\\' rights.[317] According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.[318]\\nQatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup\\xa0– the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[319]\\nDue to Qatar\\'s laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated \"sobering-up\" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[320] Qatar\\'s World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans\\' safety.[321] If a fan was sent to the \"sobering up\" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour.[322] Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a \"cultural clash\" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the \"norms\" of secular Western liberal democracies.[11][323]\\nA number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[324][325] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][298] worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans,[298] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[326][327][328] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[329] Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country\\'s modesty and avoid public displays of affection.[330][331] Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country\\'s World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event,[332][333] even though drinking in public was not permitted.[334] There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages.[335] Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only.[336] However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.[335][337][338][339][340]\\nThe climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December.[5] In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a \"mistake\" because of the extreme heat.[5][341][342] While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were \"very much linked to racism and discrimination\".[343] The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.[344]\\nPrior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark\\'s TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were \"mistakenly interrupted\".[345] Tony O\\'Donoghue of Ireland\\'s RTÉ also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.[346]\\nOn 5 November 2022, The Sunday Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar\\'s hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.[347]\\nThere was criticism regarding the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.[351] On 23 October 2022, an article published by The Guardian included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable.[352] Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.[353]\\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"[354]\\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar\\'s decision to host the tournament.[355] Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.[356]\\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[5] In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[357] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[358] to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[359][360]\\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[361] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[362]\\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[363] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League\\'s popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[364] In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December.[365] Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.[366]\\nSome allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid.[367] A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5\\xa0million by Qatar.[368] She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials.[369][370] In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2\\xa0million from a firm linked to Qatar\\'s successful campaign.[371]\\nThe Sunday Times published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.[372] Five of FIFA\\'s six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.[373][374] Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.[375][376] FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.[377][378]\\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA\\'s main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150\\xa0million corruption and bribery scandal.[379] From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[380] In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[381]\\nFollowing the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup.[382] In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\\'s Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"[383][384]\\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[385] At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.[386] Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".[386]\\nIn 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it \"does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.[387]\\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.[388] The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active.[389] The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,[390] and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.[391]\\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia\\'s participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia\\'s qualifying path—Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden—announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.[392] Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.[393][394][395]\\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia\\'s participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country\\'s name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes\\' participation in events such as the Olympics,[396] the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\".[397] The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[398]\\nThere are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans,[399] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.[400] The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands.[401] Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.[402][403]\\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows.[404][405] American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.[406] Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium.[407][408] Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl.[409] In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene.[410] An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.[411]\\nDiscrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized.[412][413] Women in Qatar have few freedoms,[412][414] as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.[415]\\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.[416]\\nIn November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[417] in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.[418]\\nIn November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.[419] On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium\\'s security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.[420] These included t-shirts and signs with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" embedded onto them, Iran\\'s previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini.[421] This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran\\'s matches at the World Cup.[417] In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.[422]\\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.[423][424] Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.[425]\\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,[425] the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.[426]\\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them.[298][427][428] Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed.[429] The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.[430]\\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.[431] The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.[432][433] The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.[434][435] The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.[436]\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\nJohn Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954)[1][2] is an American actor. Travolta started acting in television before transitioning his career as a leading man in films. His accolades include an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, nominations for two Academy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.\\nTravolta came to prominence starring in the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), followed by leading roles in Carrie (1976), Grease (1978), Urban Cowboy (1980), and Blow Out (1981). He earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Pulp Fiction (1994). His other notable films include Get Shorty (1995), Broken Arrow (1996), Michael (1996), Face/Off (1997), A Civil Action (1998), Primary Colors (1998), The General\\'s Daughter (1999), Wild Hogs (2007), Hairspray (2007), Bolt (2008), and Savages (2012).\\nTravolta returned to television portraying lawyer Robert Shapiro in the ABC first season of the anthology series American Crime Story, subtitled The People v. O. J. Simpson. He received a Primetime Emmy Award as a producer as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. He was also Emmy-nominated for his role in Die Hart (2021).\\nOutside of acting, Travolta is also a singer-songwriter. He has released nine albums, including four singles that have charted on the Billboard Hot 100\\'s Top 40. His albums have been typically accompanied films he has starred in, such as Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture (1978)–which topped the Billboard 200. Travolta is also a private pilot.[3]\\nThe youngest of six children,[4] Travolta was born[1] and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, an inner-ring suburb of New York City in Bergen County, New Jersey.\\nHis father, Salvatore \"Sam\" Travolta was a semiprofessional American football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company, Travolta Tire Exchange.[5][1] His mother, Helen Cecilia (née Burke) was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher.[6] His siblings Joey, Ellen, Ann, Margaret, and Sam Travolta were all inspired by their mother\\'s love of theatre and drama and became actors.[6] His father was a second-generation Italian American with roots in Godrano, Sicily, and his mother was Irish American.[7][8]\\nHe grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood and said that his household was predominantly Irish in culture.[9][10] He was raised Catholic, but later converted to Scientology in 1975 at age 21.[8][11] Travolta attended Dwight Morrow High School, but dropped out as a junior at age 17 in 1971.[12]\\nAfter dropping out of school, Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical Grease and on Broadway in Over Here!, singing the Sherman Brothers\\' song \"Dream Drummin\\'\".[13][14] He then moved to Los Angeles for professional reasons. Travolta\\'s first screen role in California was as a fall victim in Emergency! (Season 2, Episode 2) in September, 1972,[15] but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek\\'s character in the horror film Carrie (1976) directed by Brian de Palma.[16] Around that time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the ABC TV sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack\\'s mother).[17]\\nTravolta had a hit single titled \"Let Her In\", peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July 1976.[18][19][20] In the next few years, he starred in the television movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble and two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in the dance drama Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Danny Zuko in the musical Grease (1978).[6] The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom.[21] Saturday Night Fever earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor,[22] making him, at age 24, one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.[23] His mother and his sister Ann appeared very briefly in Saturday Night Fever and his sister Ellen played a waitress in Grease. Travolta performed on the Grease soundtrack album.[24] After the failure of the romance Moment by Moment (1978) in which he starred with Lily Tomlin, Travolta rebounded in 1980, riding a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film Urban Cowboy, in which he starred with Debra Winger.[25]\\nTravolta followed up Urban Cowboy with a starring role in Brian de Palma\\'s 1981 film Blow Out, which was critically lauded but a box office disappointment, likely due to its bleak ending.[26] After Blow Out came a series of commercial and critical failures which sidelined Travolta\\'s acting career. These included Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy reuniting him with Olivia Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis. He also starred in Staying Alive, the 1983 sequel to Saturday Night Fever, for which he trained rigorously to portray a professional dancer and lost 20 pounds;[27] the film was a financial success, grossing over $65\\xa0million, though it, too, was scorned by critics.\\nDuring that time, Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including American Gigolo[28] and An Officer and a Gentleman, both of which went to Richard Gere, as well as Splash, which went to Tom Hanks.[29]\\nIn 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who\\'s Talking, which grossed $297\\xa0million, making it his most successful film since Grease. He subsequently starred in Look Who\\'s Talking Too (1990) and Look Who\\'s Talking Now (1993), but it was not until he played against type as Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino\\'s hit Pulp Fiction (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career was revived.[6][30][31] It was Travolta\\'s third film alongside Bruce Willis.[32] The movie shifted him back onto the A-list and he was inundated with many diverse offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), a factory worker in White Man\\'s Burden (1995), a corrupt U.S. Air Force pilot in Broken Arrow (1996), an everyman with extraordinary powers in Phenomenon (1996), an archangel in Michael (1996), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton–esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998),[6] and a military investigator in The General\\'s Daughter (1999).\\nIn 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film Battlefield Earth, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the villainous leading role as a leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film was a dream project for Travolta since the book\\'s release in 1982, when Hubbard wrote to him to try to help make a film adaptation.[33] The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office.[34] Travolta\\'s performance in Battlefield Earth also earned him two Razzie Awards.\\nThroughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in Swordfish (2001); Domestic Disturbance (2001); Ladder 49 (2004); Be Cool (2005); Lonely Hearts (2006); Wild Hogs (2007); the Disney computer-animated film Bolt (2008), in which Travolta voiced the title character; The Taking of Pelham 123; and Old Dogs (both 2009).\\nIn 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of Hairspray, his first musical since Grease.[35]\\nSince 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in action films and thrillers, such as From Paris with Love (2010) and Savages (2012). In 2013 at the 86th Academy Awards, Travolta notoriously mispronounced Idina Menzel, calling her \"Adele Dazeem\". Menzel performed the award-winning song \"Let It Go\" from the Disney animated movie Frozen. In 2016, he returned to television in the first season of the anthology series American Crime Story, titled The People v. O. J. Simpson, in which he played lawyer Robert Shapiro.[36] For his performance he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\\nFollowing the death of his wife Kelly Preston in July 2020, Travolta hinted on his Instagram account that he would be putting his career on hold, stating \"I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don\\'t hear from us for a while\".[37]\\nTravolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976). They remained together until Hyland\\'s death from breast cancer on March 27, 1977. In 1980, Travolta dated French actress Catherine Deneuve.[38] Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985.[39] In 1988 while filming The Experts, Travolta met actress Kelly Preston, whom he married in Paris in 1991. They had three children: Jett (1992–2009), Ella Bleu (b. 2000), and Benjamin (b. 2010).[40] They regularly attended marriage counseling and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage.[41] They resided in Ocala, Florida.\\nOn January 2, 2009, Jett died at age 16 while on a Christmas vacation in the Bahamas.[42][43] A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure.[44] Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly had had Kawasaki disease since the age of two.[45][46] Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and had regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony at a multimillion-dollar extortion plot against him in connection with Jett\\'s death.[47] After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett\\'s death and move forward with his career.[48][49][50] In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs.[51] It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center.[52]\\nOn July 12, 2020, Travolta\\'s wife, Kelly Preston, died at the age of 57, at their home in Anthony, Florida,[53][54] two years after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.[55] Preston had undergone treatment at different hospitals, and at the time of her death, was receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.[56]\\nTravolta joined the Church of Scientology in 1975. He converted after being given the book Dianetics from former actress Joan Prather.[57]\\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area.[58]\\nTravolta is a pilot[3][a] and rated to fly Boeing 737, 707, and 747 planes.[citation needed] He owns four aircraft. Travolta owned an ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) which bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew.[59] Travolta named his 707 \"Jett Clipper Ella\", in honor of his children. The \"Clipper\" in the name refers to the use of that word by Pan Am in the names of their aircraft.[60] In 2017, Travolta donated the Boeing 707 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia. This was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019,[61] but was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft.[62] Travolta planned to be on board when the aircraft was to be flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, however was not allowed to fly it, because it was to be registered as an Australian aircraft.[61]\\nOn November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller.[63]\\nIn 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF.[64] Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show\\'s official ambassador.[65]\\nOn September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year.[66]\\nHe is the author of the book Propeller One-Way Night Coach, the story of a young boy\\'s first flight.[67]\\nHis estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes.[3][68]\\nIn May 2012, an anonymous male masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were \"complete fiction and fabrication\". Travolta\\'s counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would \"sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution\" after getting the case thrown out.[69] A second masseur later joined the lawsuit, making similar claims.[70][71] Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice.[72]\\nOn September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.[73]\\nTravolta was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performances in Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for his performance in Get Shorty and has received a total of six nominations, the most recent being in 2011. In 2014, he received the IIFA Award for Outstanding Achievement in International Cinema.[84]\\n'),\n",

       "  'Hawkwoman is the name of several superheroines all owned by DC Comics and existing in that company\\'s DC Universe. They are partners, and sometimes spouses or lovers, of the various versions of Hawkman, and share many features with the character Hawkgirl. The first version appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (February/March 1961).[1]\\nYears before the events told in the Invasion story arc, Fel Andar, a Thanagarian spy, was sent to Earth to infiltrate among humans. Eventually he met and married an Earth woman, Sharon Parker, who would soon give birth to Charley Parker, later known as the Golden Eagle.\\nWhen Charley was four years old, Thanagar called Andar to active duty, so he joined the Justice League International claiming to be Carter and Shiera Hall\\'s son Carter Hall, Jr. Andar never told the Thanagarian Empire about Charley, so he mindwiped Sharon, forcing her to take the identity of Hawkwoman Sharon Hall, wife of Carter Hall Jr. \\nWhen Sharon learned about the masquerade she exposed the truth to J\\'onn J\\'onzz and Maxwell Lord. Confronted by both, Andar escaped back to Thanagar and Sharon perished.\\nShayera Thal II is the illegitimate daughter of Shayera Thal I and Andar Pul, Thanagar\\'s Administrator of Protection and close friend of Shayera I\\'s father Thal Provis. Andar Pul had seduced the then 13-year-old Shayera I and her pregnancy became a political scandal that threatened to put her father\\'s political activities to a hold. As a result, Shayera II was abandoned in Downside by her mother shortly after her birth.\\nWhen she was ten, she first met Wingman ensign Katar Hol during his first mission to the Thanagarian ghettos. Her mother was killed in a terrorist bombing.\\nWhen Shayera lost her Downside guardian as a result of a police action she was sent to an orphanage in the High Towers. Here she was found and adopted by Thal Provis, whose grief over the loss of his own daughter, had led him to find and reclaim his granddaughter. She was unaware Provis was really her grandfather until much later.\\nAs a young woman, Shayera became a Wingmen and eventually meets Katar Hol again. She helped him stop Byth\\'s drug smuggling.\\nIn the early 1990s, Thanagarian policemen partners Katar Hol and Shayera Thal arrived on Earth (following an attempted Thanagarian invasion of Earth) with the mission to capture the Thanagarian shapeshifting criminal Byth. They were part of a force which used the hawk as their symbol, and also had a winged, gravity-defying harness. Together they fought crime on Earth and corruption on Thanagar for some time, eventually falling in love and deciding to remain on Earth and build a life there rather than return to their homeworld. Then came the events of Zero Hour where Katar was merged with Carter and Shiera Hall in a new Hawkman version, who was then possessed by a creature from the red known as the Hawk Avatar. Fundamentally changed, he swore off his relationship with Shayera, and she retired from superhero work to become a cop in Detroit. The \"new\" Hawkman adventured for a brief time before going insane and being banished into limbo.\\nShortly after that, Kendra Saunders became the new Hawkgirl, and Carter Hall, the original Hawkman, was resurrected. Shayera met them during her final battle against Byth when the three Hawks, aided by Animal Man, defeated the Thanagarian criminal for good.\\nIn the Rann-Thanagar War miniseries, Shayera Thal reappeared as a reinstated soldier of the Thanagarian Army, last seen fighting with the invasion force of Polara. She considered reborn Hawkman Carter Hall and Hawkgirl Kendra Saunders friends of Thanagar, but grew angry with their ally Adam Strange blaming Rannian science for the destruction of her birth world. Despite this, she reluctantly served alongside him as a comrade-in-arms during the war.\\nShayera was betrayed and murdered by Tamaranean Queen Komand\\'r. Her body was sent on a trajectory into Thanagar\\'s sun, Polaris, the heroes\\' resting place in Thanagarian tradition.[2]\\nFollowing DC\\'s 2011 relaunch, Shayera Thal is revealed as the princess of Thanagar and the former lover of Katar Hol. Initially, she is depicted as a villain, after erroneously believing her lover Katar Hol has killed her brother, Emperor Corsar, vowing vengeance upon him.[3] But after it is discovered that Corsar survived and was manipulating the situation Shayera betrays him and saves Katar\\'s life, seemingly sacrificing her own for it,[4] although, it is later revealed that she survived.[5]\\nA hybridization of the Shayera Hol and Shayera Thal incarnations of Hawkwoman appears in Young Justice, voiced by Zehra Fazal.[7][8] This version is a member of the Justice League along with her husband Hawkman and primarily makes minor recurring appearances. During the second season, she and the Justice League fall under the Light\\'s control and are forced to attack the planet Rimbor. The Leaguers are later forced to return to Rimbor to stand trial. They are eventually found guilty, but Superboy, Miss Martian, and Adam Strange present new evidence and force the Rimbor Tribunal to reverse their verdict.\\n'),\n",

       "  'Catarrh (/kəˈtɑːr/) is an inflammation of mucous membranes in one of the airways or cavities of the body,[1][2] usually with reference to the throat and paranasal sinuses. It can result in a thick exudate of mucus and white blood cells caused by the swelling of the mucous membranes in the head in response to an infection. It is a symptom usually associated with the common cold, pharyngitis, and chesty coughs, but it can also be found in patients with adenoiditis, otitis media, sinusitis or tonsillitis.  The phlegm produced by catarrh may either discharge or cause a blockage that may become chronic.\\nThe word \"catarrh\" was widely used in medicine since before the era of medical science, which explains why it has various senses and in older texts may be synonymous with, or vaguely indistinguishable from, common cold, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, or sinusitis. The word is no longer as widely used in American medical practice, mostly because more precise words are available for any particular disease. Indeed, to the extent that it is still used, it is no longer viewed nosologically as a disease entity but instead as a symptom, a sign, or a syndrome of both. The term \"catarrh\" is found in medical sources from the United Kingdom.[3] The word has also been common in the folk medicine of Appalachia, where medicinal plants have been used to treat the inflammation and drainage associated with the condition.[4]\\nBecause of the human ear\\'s function of regulating the pressure within the head region, catarrh blockage may also cause discomfort during changes in atmospheric pressure.\\nThe word \"catarrh\" comes from 15th-century French catarrhe, Latin catarrhus, and Greek Ancient Greek: καταρρεῖν[5] (katarrhein): kata- meaning \"down\" and rhein meaning \"to flow.\" The Oxford English Dictionary quotes Thomas Bowes\\' translation of Pierre de la Primaudaye\\'s The [second part of the] French academie (1594): \"Sodainely choked by catarrhes, which like to floods of waters, runne downewards.\"[6]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Push dagger',\n",
       "  'A push dagger (alternately known as a punch dagger, punch knife, push knife or, less often, a push dirk) is a short-bladed dagger with a \"T\" handle designed to be grasped and held in a closed-fist hand so that the blade protrudes from the front of the fist, either between the index and middle fingers or between the two central fingers, when the grip and blade are symmetrical.[1][2]\\nIt originated as a close-combat weapon for civilians in the early 19th century, and also saw some use in the trench warfare of World War I.[2][3]\\nThe  16th-century Indian katar (कटार), or punching sword, has been compared to the push dagger.[1][2]  \\nThis weapon is analogous, or a remote predecessor at best, as the katar is gripped by two close-set vertical bars, while a push dagger uses a T-handle and a blade that protrudes between the fingers when properly gripped.[1]\\nThe push dagger appears to originate in the 19th-century Southern United States.[3][4]  Politicians wore them into state and federal buildings, even the United States Capitol.[3][4] As a concealable weapon, the push dagger was a favorite choice of civilian owners requiring a discreet knife capable of being used for personal protection.[3]  Before the development of reliable small pistols such as the derringer, the push dagger was especially popular among riverboat gamblers and residents of the larger towns and cities of the Old Southwest, particularly gamblers and émigrés from the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.[5][6][2][7]\\nThe New Orleans-style push dagger was known as the gimlet knife.[5]  The gimlet knife had a short two-inch (50\\xa0mm) blade with a \"gimlet\" or T-handle.[5]  It was a common weapon in the city during the 1800s and was usually slipped into a boot or concealed inside a coat sleeve or else hung on a waistcoat button by a strap attached to the knife\\'s leather sheath.[8][5]  The gimlet knife was used in so many riots, fights, and murders in New Orleans that the city passed an ordinance in 1879 prohibiting anyone within city limits from selling, offering or exhibiting such a weapon for sale.[9][10][5][6]\\nThe push dagger also was a favorite weapon in 19th-century San Francisco, California.[11]  The San Francisco style of push dagger tended to have a slightly longer blade than that of the gimlet knife and was most often equipped with a T-handle made of walrus ivory.[11]\\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, the push dagger also enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Britain and Central Europe, particularly in Germany, where it was called the Stoßdolch or Faustmesser, meaning \"push-dagger\" and \"fist-knife\", respectively.  The weapon is thought to have been introduced there in the mid-1800s by foreign sailors visiting North German ports.  German cutlery makers began to manufacture domestic versions of the design, often set in nickel-silver mountings.  The Stoßdolch was sold primarily as a self-defense weapon for travelers, salesmen, and others who required a compact, concealable weapon.  Push daggers continued to be sold in Britain and Europe through the end of the 19th century, when the combination of more effective police forces and the availability of inexpensive small handguns caused a substantial decline in sales and usage of push daggers and other types of specialized fighting knives.[citation needed]\\nThe reality of static trench warfare in World War I created a need for short, handy close-combat weapons that could be used in the confines of a trench.  With pistols in short supply, a variety of knives and other stabbing weapons were created or issued to troops serving in the trenches.  Originally most of these weapons were fabricated in the field from readily available materials such as metal stakes, but soon factory-made examples of knuckle knives and push daggers appeared at the front, and were used by both sides in the war. In Britain the Robbins-Dudley Co. of Dudley, Worcestershire, a metalworking company, was one of the first commercial producers of specialized wartime knuckle-knives and push daggers for private sale to individual soldiers and officers.[12]  The typical Robbins-Dudley push dagger – referred to as a \\'punch knife\\' by its maker – utilized an aluminium \"knuckle\"-type handle cast onto a 3.625-inch (92.1\\xa0mm) heat-treated steel dagger blade or alternatively, a 5-inch (130\\xa0mm) metal spike, which was subsequently blackened to prevent reflections in moonlight.[12][13]\\nThe push dagger re-emerged during World War II, where it was first issued as combat weapon for British commandos, SAS, SOE, and other specialized raiding or guerrilla forces requiring a compact and concealable weapon for sentry elimination or close-quarters fighting.[14]\\nDuring the 1980s, several new versions of the push dagger concept were produced by a variety of specialty cutlery manufacturers, and were sold primarily as \"tactical\" or self-defense weapons, particularly in the U.S.\\nThe sale and possession (or possession in public) of a push dagger with blade perpendicular to the handle is prohibited in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Canada although if the edge is parallel to the handle they are legal.[15][16][17] The laws of many countries and several U.S. states and cities prohibit or criminalize to some degree the purchase, possession, or sale of push daggers or knuckle knives.[18][19][20][21]\\n'),\n",

In the absence of any strong resistance, the division quickly achieved major territorial gains and constructed a link between the Indian and Pakistani rail lines between Munabao in Rajasthan to Khokhrapar in Sindh to support further operations.[12]\\nDespite the early gains, persistent air attacks by the Pakistan Air Force, supply and logistical problems and finally prolonged hesitation by the division halted the advance on the northern axis, before the troops reached Naya Chor. During this time, Pakistani troops were reinforced by 60 Brigade from 33 Division, which also took over the command of 55 Brigade. On the southern axis, 31 Brigade captured Chachra. Further advances were prevented as the ceasefire was declared.[13][8] Following the operations, the division captured approximately 9,000 square kilometres of Pakistani territory, the largest in the western sector.[14] The division won the following honours[1][15] – \\nThe present formation sign has a black background signifying an infantry division and a Katar facing upwards.

       "  'Hawkman (Carter Hall) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is the first character to use the name Hawkman. There are two separate origins of Carter Hall; the Golden Age origin and the Post-Hawkworld (or current) origin.\\nThe character made its live-action debut in the television series Smallville, played by Michael Shanks. He also appeared in the Arrowverse crossover \"Heroes Join Forces\" and in Legends of Tomorrow,  played by Falk Hentschel. Hawkman appears in the DC Extended Universe film Black Adam (2022), played by Aldis Hodge.\\nGardner Fox recalled the initial inspiration for the character stating, \"As I sat by the window I noticed a bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought. \\'Wouldn\\'t it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig was a crook!\\'\"[1]\\nThe character first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville.\\nIn the days of ancient Egypt, Prince Khufu was engaged in a feud with his rival, the Hungarian priest Hath-Set, who captured Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and killed them. In 1940, Khufu reincarnates as American archaeologist Carter Hall, and Chay-Ara as Shiera Sanders. Hath-Set reincarnates as a scientist named Anton Hastor. Upon finding the ancient knife Hath-Set used to kill him, Hall regains his memories of his past life and recognizes Hastor as the reincarnated evil priest. Using the properties of \"Nth metal\" (initially called \"Ninth metal\") to craft a gravity-defying belt, Hall creates wings and a costume, and confronts Hastor as Hawkman. He also encounters and remembers Shiera. Following Hastor\\'s defeat, the two begin a romance.[2]\\nHawkman becomes a charter member of the Justice Society of America and takes the position of permanent chairman, following the Flash and Green Lantern. Shiera adopts the identity of Hawkgirl and fights beside Hall throughout the 1940s. In 1942, Carter enlists in the U.S. Army Air Force as an Airman[3] and serves as a pilot with the 1st Interceptor Command during World War II.[4]\\nHawkman is JSA chairman in 1951 when the team is investigated by the \"Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee\" (based on the real-life House Un-American Activities Committee) for possible communist sympathies. Congress asks members of the JSA to reveal their identities. The heroes decline, and Hawkman and most of the JSA retire for the bulk of the 1950s.\\nThe JSA and Hawkman regroup in the early 1960s following the Flash\\'s meeting with his counterpart from the parallel world Earth-1, the JSA being active on Earth-2. Around this time, the Halls have married and have a son named Hector. During the 1960s, Hawkman appeared at the JSA\\'s annual meeting with Earth-1\\'s Justice League of America.\\nIn the early 1980s, Hawkman is instrumental in denying his son and other JSA children membership of the JSA, leading directly to the formation of Infinity, Inc.\\nFollowing Crisis on Infinite Earths, some of Hall\\'s history was retconned by DC when the parallel worlds were combined into one but one piece of retroactive continuity was written before Crisis and fills out early Hall history. All-Star Squadron Annual #3 states during a JSA battle against Ian Karkull, the villain imbues them with energy that retards their aging, allowing Hall and many others\\xa0– as well as their spouses\\xa0– to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity.\\nFollowing the Crisis, the Golden Age and the Silver Age Hawkmen live on the same Earth until Carter is cast into Limbo in the Last Days of the Justice Society of America story.\\nThe original Hawkworld miniseries retells the origins of Katar Hol and Shayera Thal from a modern perspective but following its success, DC launched a Hawkworld regular series, which takes place after the miniseries, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman\\'s continuity.\\nMuch of Carter Hall\\'s post-Hawkworld history is detailed in DC\\'s Justice Society of America and Hawkman (vol. 4), which were written mostly by David S. Goyer, Geoff Johns, and James Dale Robinson, and examine Hall\\'s previous lives.\\nAccording to the post-Hawkworld origin, Prince Khufu lives during the reign of Ramesses II in the 19th dynasty of ancient Egypt. Khufu believes his ka, or soul, will not journey on to the land of the afterlife but that his soul and that of his betrothed, Chay-Ara, are fated to remain in the mortal world.\\nAs prophesied by the wizard Nabu, a spacecraft lands in Egypt. Prince Khufu, Nabu, and the champion Teth-Adam search the desert and find the remains of a Thanagarian ship styled with a hawk-like motif. Nabu casts a spell translating the strange language of the female space traveler. Just before dying, she whispers the words \"Nth metal\", the name of the substance that powered the downed ship.\\nTeth-Adam lifts the ship back to Khufu\\'s palace, where it is studied inside the Temple of Horus at Erdu. The remaining Nth metal is examined; its most obvious property is its ability to negate gravity. The remaining sample from the ship is melted and used to create several remarkable devices, including a scarab that allows Khufu to fly, a deadly knife, and a battle glove referred to as the Claw of Horus. The metal also strengthens the souls of Khufu and Chay-Ara, binding them together in their love and imprinting them with the collective knowledge of Thanagar. The villainous priest Hath-Set murders the two with the knife of Nth metal but their souls remain in the mortal plane. They are reincarnated over many lifetimes, always finding true love in each other but are cursed to be repeatedly killed at the hands of a reincarnated Hath-Set.\\nAfter his death, Khufu\\'s soul is reincarnated countless times in different eras and locations. Some of his known reincarnated identities have been depicted in Hawkman (vol. 4) and include, but are not limited to:\\nThe soul of Prince Khufu is eventually reborn as Carter Hall, an archaeologist who is active during the 1940s. After regaining the memories of his first life in Egypt, Hall uses the hawk motif of the Egyptian god Horus to inspire his role as Hawkman.\\nHis lover Chay-Ara is reborn as archaeologist Shiera Saunders. After the two meet and marry, she becomes Hawkgirl, fighting at Carter\\'s side. They become founding members of the Justice Society of America, and Hawkman takes the role of chairman. The pair reduce their activities in the early 1950s but become fully active again in the early 1980s, when Hall briefly joins the Justice League of America as a mentor. The two have a son called Hector Hall, who later becomes an incarnation of Doctor Fate. Just after the Crisis on Infinite Earths maxiseries, Hawkman and the JSA become trapped in a battle in an ever-repeating Ragnarök.\\nYears after they vanish, Hawkman and the JSA return to the early 21st century when a primitive but superpowered tribe volunteer to substitute themselves in the Ragnarök cycle. Soon after, however, Carter dies once again during the events of Zero Hour. He and his wife Shiera merge with Katar Hol and a \"hawk god\" creature in a new version of Hawkman, attributed to them being fundamentally unstable due to their complex origins as a result of the last Crisis. This individual is active for a brief time but loses his sanity and is banished to Limbo.\\nYears later, JSA member Kendra Saunders is transported to a ravaged Thanagar by the High Priests of the Downsiders. Seeking a champion to stop the evil Onimar Synn from enslaving the planet, the priests use Kendra\\'s centuries-old connection to Carter to bring him back to the mortal plane. Following this unorthodox resurrection, Hall retains all of the memories of his past lives, as well as those of Katar Hol, the Thanagarian Hawkman. Kendra has no interest in renewing the relationship due to her lack of memories of their shared past, and the role as chairman of the JSA goes to Mister Terrific. During the \"Black Reign\" storyline, however, Hawkman takes over as chairman to lead the team against Black Adam\\'s recent takeover of Khandaq, but after his actions result in two deaths, he is asked to temporarily step down from the JSA.\\nAfter defeating Onimar Synn, Hall once again becomes a member of the JSA. Operating both with the JSA and with Hawkgirl, Hall embarks on exotic adventures that take him from the streets of St. Roch to exotic dimensions and into outer space as he fights in the Rann-Thanagar War. Following this event Carter stays in space to help mediate the truce on Rann and avenge the murder of Hawkwoman.\\nAs a result, Hawkman is absent during DC Comics\\' One Year Later event. Hawkman (vol. 4) becomes Hawkgirl at issue #50. During the events of the missing year, Hall serves as a member of the Thanagarian police force, attaining the rank of Commissioner.\\nIn 2007, Hall returns to Earth in a four-part story-arc presented in Hawkgirl #59-60 and JSA Classified #21-22 and appears as an active member of the JSA in the pages of Justice Society of America. This series was canceled with Hawkgirl issue #66 in July 2007.\\nAfter that, it is stated Katar Hol\\'s soul has passed on from the realm of limbo, as have his memories that existed in Carter\\'s mind. Despite this, Carter still exists in a reconstructed version of Katar Hol\\'s body. In a Hawkman Special published in August 2008, the mysterious being called Demiurge tells Carter Hall his previous existence as Prince Khufu is an illusion.  As Demiurge departs, he calls Hawkman \"Katar Hol\", indicating Hawkman is Katar Hol, who believed he was Carter Hall.\\nHall briefly assists the Justice League during their battle with the Shadow Cabinet by knocking out Hardware as he tried to flee from the JLA Watchtower with Arthur Light\\'s corpse. In the aftermath of the battle, Carter reunites with Kendra after her relationship with Red Arrow ends.\\nDuring the Final Crisis crossover event, Hawkman and all of the other heroes fight to stop Darkseid from destroying the DC Multiverse. In an attempt to save civilians, Checkmate creates a dimensional tunnel between universes. It begins breaking down and Lord Eye tries to close it, which will kill all the people who are still in the tunnel. Hawkman and Hawkgirl destroy Lord Eye but are caught in the explosion. All of the other people are safely transported via a second Boom Tube. This fulfills the prophecy of the Demiurge.[5] While it is implied Hawkman and Hawkgirl are dead, author Geoff Johns has stated they are alive at the beginning of the upcoming event, the Blackest Night.[6] It is later confirmed in Justice League of America Hawkgirl is alive but is hospitalized.\\nIn Blackest Night #1, Kendra argues with Hawkman over whether to visit Jean Loring\\'s grave with the Atom. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of Ralph and Sue Dibny, who are now members of the Black Lantern Corps, enter Hawkman\\'s sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, who is killed shortly afterwards. Both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by Black Hand.[7]\\nIt was also revealed in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46 Khufu\\'s and Chay-Ara\\'s bodies were taken from Earth by the Zamarons and placed in the violet central power battery. Their love is the source of the Star Sapphire\\'s powers. The pair receive black rings during the battle on Zamaron. Their escape from the central power battery causes widespread destruction on the planet.[8]\\nDuring the battle at Coast City, the Atom is chosen by the Indigo Tribe to be more effective against Nekron\\'s forces.[9] The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.[10] In the final battle, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are resurrected by the white light. Kendra is revealed to be Shiera Hall, who remembers her past lives; she and Carter joyfully reunite.[11]\\nIn the Brightest Day crossover event, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to Hawkworld. While there, Carter is told by the Entity to \"stop the Queen Khea\" from leaving.[12] While Hawkgirl is held by Hath-Set and his Queen Khea, Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. Hawkman hears Hawkgirl\\'s cries and goes to rescue her. His arrival leads to a confrontation with Queen Khea, who is Shiera Hall\\'s mother. During the fight, Queen Khea controls his Nth metal mace and armor, and Hawkman is tied together with Hawkgirl. Queen Khea opens a gateway and enters the portal to the Zamaron homeworld.[13] When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire (Carol Ferris) frees them both to stop Queen Khea\\'s invasion. The two attack Queen Khea as Hawkgirl wants to face her, but the Predator Entity bonds with the Queen.[14]\\nShiera and Carter separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway. Animated by the violet light of love, the bones grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian central power battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished and their lives returned, are teleported back to St. Roch by Carol. Carter and Shiera are interrupted by Deadman, whose white ring tells them that they should lead separate lives. Carter refuses and the ring responds \"So be it\" and unleashes a blast of white light that kills Hawkman and Hawkgirl, turning them into dust.[15] Deadman orders the ring to resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl but it refuses, saying Hawkman was brought back to life to overcome what held him back in his past life because he was essential in saving Earth.[16]\\nWhen the \"Dark Avatar\" makes his presence known, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are revealed to be part of the Elementals, guardians of the forest located in Star City. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the \"Dark Avatar\", which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing.[17] The Elementals are then fused with Alec Holland\\'s body so he can be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Hawkman discovers Sheira was not resurrected. Swamp Thing tells him Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she is still the elemental of air. Afterward, Hawkman returns home yelling \"Shiera!\"[18]\\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC\\'s continuity. In this new timeline, Hall tries to rid himself of his Hawkman armor by burning and burying it in a forest. However, the Nth metal suit re-bonds with him, preventing Hall from escaping his life as Hawkman.[19] It is later revealed the current Hawkman is actually Katar Hol, with \"Carter Hall\" being an assumed identity.[citation needed]\\nThe real Carter Hall returns as Hawkman to the DC Universe in Dark Days: The Forge. His origin as a pharaoh who is constantly being reincarnated is used for the character. Carter Hall is an archaeologist who is researching the origin of Nth metal and the powers it gives him. At some point, Carter encountered Barbatos and hit him with his mace. When the aged Batman and Superman arrive at the World Forge, they are met by a gigantic, hammer-wielding, hawk-like beast that proclaims it is Carter Hall, the dragon of Barbatos and Keeper of the Dark Forge, and that only endings are at the World Forge.[20]\\nA new Hawkman series was announced in March 2017; it was written by Robert Venditti and illustrated by Bryan Hitch. The book explores Carter Hall\\'s experiences after the events of Dark Nights: Metal and his relationship to Hawkgirl.[21]\\nThe comic\\'s first arc deals with Hall, who believes there are gaps in the memories of his past lives. He recovers a mystical artifact that allows him to unlock all of his memories. He becomes aware of multiple incarnations of himself, which include Katar Hol, and has a vision of a future Earth that has destroyed by gigantic, winged creatures that are later revealed to be spaceships known as the Deathbringers. Hall deduces his first human incarnation Prince Khufu had the same vision, resulting in a winged figure becoming an important symbol throughout his life. \\nCarter Hall also discovers he has also lived multiple lives on alien worlds, and that on at least one occasion, two or more of his reincarnations have existed simultaneously. The other lives revealed are:\\nHis lives throughout Earth\\'s history include:\\nHe also spent centuries being reincarnated on the planet Nebulen, which was being fought over by two alien armies in a seemingly endless war. Hawkman was endlessly reincarnated as a common foot soldier, alternately being part of each side. He eventually ends the war by walking into the no-man\\'s land alone and unarmed, offering his food to the opposing side. A redheaded female enemy soldier, potentially a reincarnation of Hawkgirl, leaves her trenches to meet with him and exchange food. Both sides then abandoned the conflict and made peace, deserting en masse to settle together on Nebulen, which grows into an advanced and peaceful society. A statue memorializes the anonymous soldier whose gesture of peace ended the war.[22]\\nWith the aid of the descendants of people he saved in previous lives, Carter begins following a trail of clues left by his past selves to uncover the mystery of his vision, while also being randomly being pulled through time and space by unknown means to encounter his past selves. This journey leads him to the Microverse and into deep space. He deduces his past selves knew the purpose of the visions of the Deathbringers and realized they were starting to forget, and therefore left the trail for their future incarnations.\\nCarter experiences a vision of his original incarnation, Ktar Deathbringer, who was general of the Deathbringers, a race of winged, humanoid aliens who cut a swathe through the galaxy in the distant past, slaughtering millions on Earth, Rann, Thanagar, Krypton, and many others. The Deathbringers would sacrifice the few survivors on their temple world Qgga to a being known as the \"Lord Beyond the Void\". At each battlefield, Ktar would be visited by an apparition of a red-haired woman, who later revealed to be the Herald Shrra, the original incarnation of Hawkwoman. With each slaughter, his guilt and self-loathing grow. On Qgga, while preparing the final sacrifice that would allow the Lord to enter the universe, Ktar is visited by the woman again and turnsw on the Deathbringers, destroying Qgga and sending the Deathbringers into the void. Upon his death, Ktar is offered a chance to atone by endlessly reincarnating, only being allowed to finally pass on when he had saved as many people as he had killed. He is also ordered to prepare for the return of the Deathbringers, who are shown to be active in the galaxy under the leadership of Idamm, Ktar\\'s long-term second in command.[23]\\nCarter\\'s search ends at the former site of Krypton. He is transported through time to Krypton\\'s last day and encounters his past self Catar-Ol, a historian and tutor to Kara Zor-El, the future Supergirl. Unlike other reincarnations, Catar also possesses past life memories and is aware of the Deathbringers. He is working to build a weapon to defeat the Deathbringers, to which the trail of clues lead, but he is unable to complete it before Krypton\\'s destruction. Carter is disheartened but Catar encourages him to find another way to save Earth, telling him he must \"be the weapon\".[24] Carter returns to Earth and seeks help from Madame Xanadu. The Deathbringers attack London and Idamm personally engages Carter.[25] Carter beats Idamm in single combat but is overwhelmed by the numbers of the Deathbringers. Taking control of the timeshifts, Carter summons all of his past selves to the present to aid him in the battle. [26] The Hawkmen put up a valiant fight but the Deathbringers are revealed to be immortal and seemingly unbeatable.[27]\\nIdamm orders the planet destroyed but Carter rallies the Hawkmen to attack the Deathbringer\\'s ships, disabling their weapons. Meanwhile, Carter duels with Idamm again. Carter beats Idamm down. Idamm eventually yields and surrenders the role of general to Carter, who orders the Deathbringers to stand down. Before returning to their proper places in the timestream, the other Hawkmen transfer their memories to Hall, allowing him to remember his full history for the first time.[28]\\nCarter discovered another of his past lives in the form of Sky Tyrant, who was Carter Hall\\'s reincarnation on Earth-3 and learned about his origins as Ktar Deathbringer and the debt he must pay. Sky Tyrant is afraid of dying and decides to prolong his \\'immortality\\' and add to the debt by killing people on his Earth. After dying, Sky Tyrant is locked away in Carter\\'s subconscious until the latter is infected by the Batman Who Laughs and a recent encounter with Shadow Thief caused Sky Tyrant to reemerge and trap Carter in his own consciousness. Sky Tyrant is confronted by Shayera Hol/Hawkwoman but soon escapes before she can defeat him. Using their shared consciousness, Sky Tyrant wishes to learn more about their history through the secret Black Journal.[29]\\nHawkwoman teams up with Carter\\'s old friends the Atom and Adam Strange to capture and cure Carter of his infection. They catch up to Sky Tyrant on an alien world where one of his previous incarnations named Titan Hawk has hidden an artifact known as \"The Key\", which would have released the Lord Beyond the Void. They recover the Key and imprison Sky Tyrant on Carter\\'s starship. When she touches the Key, her memories of all her past lives are unlocked. Sky Tyrant escapes from his cell and brawls with the three heroes; he and Shayera touch the Key together and are transported to the realm of the Lord Beyond the Void. Carter is cured of his infection. The pair are attacked by Deathbringers who recognize Carter as Ktar. Although the Deathbringers are defeated, they draw the attention of the Lord Beyond the Void.\\nThe Lord easily overpowers them and binds them to a stone monolith, planning to absorb the energy from all of their lives, which will give him sufficient power to cross over into the universe. Carter and Shayera release the power of their thousands of lives, overloading and destroying the Lord while killing themselves. They awake in the afterlife, reverted to Ktar and Shrra. The deity explains Ktar\\'s debt is repaid and offers to allow them to be reincarnated a final time in their favourite lives, where they will be extremely long-lived but mortal. The two agree and are restored to life in the 1940s as the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl, and reunite with their old friends in the Justice Society of America.\\nDuring a fight with the Injustice Society, Carter freezes with fear at a moment when the villains have the upper hand. Shayera throws her mace into Carter\\'s, creating an explosion that incapacitates the Injustice Society. The JSA assumes Carter is providing a distraction for Shayera but he admits to her now he is mortal, he fears dying. Anton Hastor, an incarnation of the Hawks\\' ancient enemy Hath-Set, learns Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara have been reincarnated, and that they can be killed permanently. Hastor steals his Nth Metal dagger from JSA headquarters and draws the Hawks out to a train, where he has killed the passengers and resurrected them as zombies. Shayera is tackled off the train by zombies while Hastor attacks Carter, who is too fearful to fight back until Hastor threatens Shayera. Carter disarms Hastor by stabbing himself with the dagger as Shayera catches up to the train and destroys the dagger while Hastor falls to his death. In the 40th century, Hawkman and Hawkwoman are greatly aged and scarred but still alive as Hawkman finishes writing his story.[30]\\nIn the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Lois Lane finds a flash drive while at the Daily Planet. It shows her footage of Hawkman and the rest of the Justice Society.[31]\\nIn the pages of \"The New Golden Age\", Hawkman was among the Justice Society members partaking in a group photo. When the Helmet of Fate started heating up after Doctor Fate has a vision of \"lost children\", Hawkman and Atom had to get the Helmet of Fate off him.[32] When a Huntress from a possible future ends up in 1940, Hawkman is among the Justice Society members that meet him. As Doctor Fate tries to read Huntress\\' mind to learn about the threat in her future, Hawkman is among those that are knocked down by the magical feedback.[33]\\nA flashback to a moment in Flash\\'s past in 1941 had Hawkman among the JSA members entering an abandoned base in Wutach Gorge and fighting some robots and Ro-Bear.[34] Hawkman and the JSA continue their search through the abandoned base. The JSA have their encounter with Doctor Elemental. With help from a time-traveling Boom, they repel Doctor Elemental who gets away by setting the base to self-destruct.[35]\\nThe Nth metal in Hawkman\\'s wings, belt, harness, and boots is controlled mentally and allows him to defy gravity. His wings allow him to control flight though they can be flapped through use of shoulder motions.\\nHall\\'s Nth metal also enhances his strength and eyesight, speeds healing, and regulates body temperature, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while flying at high altitudes. Nth metal is known to affect electromagnetism as well as the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is also mentioned in Hawkman: Secret Files and Origins #1 (2002) that Nth metal has other unknown  powers.\\nDue to his multiple incarnations and having the memories of all of them, Khufu/Hall is an expert with a wide array of archaic weapons from his past lives, including battle axes, maces, swords, spears, and shields. As Nighthawk, he was a marksman with a pistol. Carter Hall is sometimes depicted handling futuristic technology. He has used a Thanagarian ship called \"The Brontadon\" and during the Rann-Thanagar War used Rannian hard-light armor. Hawkman is depicted using technologically advanced laser weaponry in a possible future (Hawkman (vol. 4) #9). Reincarnation has also given Hawkman knowledge of hundreds of languages.\\nAs a result of his many lives and vast amount of experience, Hall is a brilliant tactician, fierce warrior, and strong leader. During the Public Enemies story arc in the Superman/Batman series, he was selected as the perfect hero to confront Batman with the advantage of his flight and strength but otherwise being Batman\\'s equal. He is extremely intelligent and expresses a deeply romantic side towards his beloved soulmate.\\nFor a brief time during \"DC Rebirth\" through a combination of the Nth Metals properties and his own cycle of reincarnation. Carter was able to summon an army of alt. selves whose lives he\\'d lived via reincarnation across Time & space.\\nHawkman has been characterized in comics as having a quick, fierce temper with adamant views and opinions. Even in the Golden Age, he has no problem blowing up a villain\\'s lair with the villain inside.[36]\\nAnother prominent aspect of his personality is his staunch conservative views; this has brought him into conflict with Green Arrow (a liberal) several times. During the miniseries Identity Crisis, it is revealed the main reason for this animosity is the opposing views he and Green Arrow take on the mindwipe of Doctor Light.\\nSince his rebirth, that Carter Hall has integrated a lot of Katar Hol into his core being. He looks like a merger of Katar and himself while using the more rugged superhero attire that is a trademark of Katar Hol. Although he has Katar\\'s dark hair, his voice and face appear to be his own as he is easily recognized by Jay Garrick upon return.\\nPost-Metal, Carter has become a more reserved character, in stark contrast of his personality Pre-Flashpoint. He now shows a deeper understanding of history and spirituality, and more reservation to entering battle, but is still willing to fight.\\nCarter Hall appears in Justice League Adventures #20 as a member of the Justice Society.\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThis article is a list of the various dynasties and monarchs that have ruled in the Indian subcontinent and it is one of several lists of incumbents.\\nThe earliest Indian rulers are known from epigraphical sources found in archeological inscriptions on Ashokan edicts[1][2] written in Pali language and using brahmi script. They are also known from the literary sources like Sanskrit literature, Jain literature and Buddhist literature in context of literary sources. Archaeological sources include archeological remains in Indian subcontinent which give many details about earlier kingdoms, monarchs, and their interactions with each other.\\nEarly types of historic documentation include metal coins with an indication of the ruler, or at least the dynasty, at the time. These Punch-marked coins were issued around 600s BCE and are found in abundance from the Maurya Empire in 300s BCE. There are also stone inscriptions and documentary records from foreign cultures from around this time.

It borders Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg,[10] is one of the four institutional seats of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority.[11][12] Luxembourg\\'s culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its French and German neighbors; while Luxembourgish is the only national language of the Luxembourgish people and of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,[13][14] French is the only language for legislation, and all three\\xa0– Luxembourgish, French and German\\xa0– are used for administrative matters in the country.[13]\\nWith an area of 2,586 square kilometers (998\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), Luxembourg is Europe\\'s seventh-smallest country.[15] In 2023, it had a population of 660,809, which makes it one of the least-populated countries in Europe,[16] albeit with the highest population growth rate;[17] foreigners account for nearly half the population.[18] Luxembourg is a representative democracy headed by a constitutional monarch, Grand Duke Henri, making it the world\\'s only remaining sovereign grand duchy.\\nLuxembourg is a developed country with an advanced economy and one of the world\\'s highest GDP (PPP) per capita as per IMF and World Bank estimates. The nation\\'s levels of human development and LGBT equality are ranked among the highest in Europe.[19][8] The city of Luxembourg was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of its vast fortifications and historic quarters.[20] Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union,[21] OECD, the United Nations, NATO, and the Benelux.[22][23] It served on the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 2013 and 2014.[24]\\nThe history of Luxembourg is considered to begin in the year 963, when Count Siegfried acquired a rocky promontory and its Roman-era fortifications, known as Lucilinburhuc, \"little castle\", and the surrounding area from the Imperial Abbey of St. Maximin in nearby Trier.[25][26] Siegfried\\'s descendants increased their territory through marriage, conquest, and vassalage. By the end of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg reigned over a considerable territory.[27] In 1308, Count of Luxembourg Henry VII became King of the Romans and later Holy Roman Emperor;[28] the House of Luxembourg would produce four Holy Roman Emperors during the High Middle Ages. In 1354, Charles IV elevated the county to the Duchy of Luxembourg.[29] The duchy eventually became part of the Burgundian Circle and then one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands.[30]\\nOver the centuries, the City and Fortress of Luxembourg—of great strategic importance due to its location between the Kingdom of France and the Habsburg territories—was gradually built up to be one of the most reputed fortifications in Europe.[31] After belonging to both the France of Louis XIV and the Austria of Maria Theresa, Luxembourg became part of the First French Republic and Empire under Napoleon.[32]\\nThe present-day state of Luxembourg first emerged at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Grand Duchy, with its powerful fortress, became an independent state under the personal possession of William I of the Netherlands with a Prussian garrison to guard the city against another invasion from France.[33][29] In 1839, following the turmoil of the Belgian Revolution, the purely French-speaking part of Luxembourg was ceded to Belgium and the Luxembourgish-speaking part (except the Arelerland, the area around Arlon) became what is the present state of Luxembourg.[34]\\nThe first traces of settlement in what is now Luxembourg are dated back to the Paleolithic Age, about 35,000 years ago. From the 2nd century BC, Celtic tribes settled in the region between the rivers Rhine and Meuse.[36]\\nSix centuries later the Romans would name the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the Treveri. Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in Luxembourg have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of the Titelberg.\\nIn around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when Julius Caesar conquered Gaul and part of Germania up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now Luxembourg became part of the Roman Empire for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the Pax Romana.\\nSimilar to those in Gaul, the Celts of Luxembourg adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as Gallo-Roman civilization.[37] Evidence from that period includes the Dalheim Ricciacum and the Vichten mosaic, on display at the National Museum of History and Art in Luxembourg City.[38]\\nThe territory was infiltrated by the Germanic Franks from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,[39]:\\u200a65\\u200a after which it became part of the Kingdom of the Franks. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day Luxembourg, since the old Frankish language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the Moselle Franconian dialect, which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day Luxembourgish language.[39]:\\u200a70\\u200a[40]\\nThe Christianization of Luxembourg is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is Willibrord, a Northumbrian missionary saint, who together with other monks established the Abbey of Echternach in AD 698[41] and is celebrated annually in the dancing procession of Echternach. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe\\'s most influential abbeys. The Codex Aureus of Echternach, an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century.[35] The so-called Emperor\\'s Bible and the Golden Gospels of Henry III were also produced in Echternach at this time.[42][43]:\\u200a9–25\\u200a\\nWhen the Carolingian Empire was divided many times starting with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, today\\'s Luxembourgish territory became successively part of the Kingdom of Middle Francia (843–855), the Kingdom of Lotharingia (855–959) and finally of the Duchy of Lorraine (959–1059), which itself had become a state of the Holy Roman Empire.[45]\\nThe recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc[46] (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin\\'s Abbey, Trier.[47] Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine.[20] Over the years, the fortress was extended by Siegfried\\'s descendants and by 1083, one of them, Conrad I, was the first to call himself a \"Count of Luxembourg\", and with it effectively creating the independent County of Luxembourg (which was still a state within the Holy Roman Empire).[48]\\nBy the middle of the 13th century the counts of Luxembourg had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river Meuse to the Moselle. By the time of the reign of Henry V the Blonde, Bitburg, La Roche-en-Ardenne, Durbuy, Arlon, Thionville, Marville, Longwy, and in 1264 the competing County of Vianden (and with it St Vith and Schleiden) had either been incorporated directly or become vassal states to the County of Luxembourg.[49] The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when Henry VI and his three brothers died at the Battle of Worringen while trying unsuccessfully to add the Duchy of Limburg to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of Luxembourg to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.[50]\\nThe ascension of the Counts of Luxembourg culminated when Henry VII became King of the Romans, King of Italy and finally, in 1312, Holy Roman Emperor.[51]\\nWith the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the House of Luxembourg not only began to rule the Holy Roman Empire, but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.\\nHenry\\'s son, John the Blind, in addition to being Count of Luxembourg, also became King of Bohemia. He remains a major figure in Luxembourgish history and folklore and is considered by many historians the epitome of chivalry in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the Schueberfouer in 1340 and for his heroic death at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.[52][53] John the Blind is considered a national hero in Luxembourg.[54]\\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John\\'s descendants Charles IV, Sigismund (who also was King of Hungary and Croatia), and Wenceslaus IV. Charles IV created the long-lasting Golden Bull of 1356, a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire. Luxembourg remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a duchy with his half-brother Wenceslaus I becoming the first Duke of Luxembourg. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the County of Chiny in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new Duchy of Luxembourg reached its greatest extent.[55]\\nDuring these 130 years, the House of Luxembourg was contending with the House of Habsburg for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and Elizabeth of Görlitz were both heirless, all possessions of the Luxembourg Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy.[56] The Duchy of Luxembourg become a possession of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.[57]\\nAs the House of Luxembourg had become extinct and Luxembourg now became part of the Burgundian Netherlands, this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over Luxembourg.\\nIn 1482, Philip the Handsome inherited all of what became then known as the Habsburg Netherlands, and with it the Duchy of Luxembourg. For nearly 320 years Luxembourg would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under Austrian rule (1506–1556), then under Spanish rule (1556–1714), before going back again to Austrian rule (1714–1794).\\nWith having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of Luxembourg became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved in the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the Kingdom of France.\\nIn 1542, the King of France, Francois I, invaded Luxembourg twice, but the Habsburgs under Charles V managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.[58]\\nLuxembourg became part of the Spanish Netherlands in 1556, and when France and Spain went to war in 1635 it resulted in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, in which the first partition of Luxembourg was decided. Under the Treaty, Spain ceded the Luxembourgish fortresses of Stenay, Thionville, and Montmédy, and the surrounding territory to France, effectively reducing the size of Luxembourg for the first time in centuries.[59]\\nIn context of the Nine Years\\' War in 1684, France invaded Luxembourg again, conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the Spanish in order to garner support for the Bourbon cause during the prelude to the War of the Spanish Succession. When the war broke out in 1701 Luxembourg and the Spanish Netherlands were administered by the pro-French faction under the governor Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro-Austrian allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to Austria at its conclusion in 1714.[60]\\nAs the Duchy of Luxembourg repeatedly passed back and forth from Spanish and Austrian to French rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the Fortress that the Castle of Luxembourg had become over the years. One example of this includes French military engineer Marquis de Vauban who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today.[59]\\nDuring the War of the First Coalition, Revolutionary France invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and with it, Luxembourg, yet again. In the years 1793 and 1794 most of the Duchy was conquered relatively quickly and the French Revolutionary Army committed many atrocities and pillages against the Luxembourgish civilian population and abbeys, the most infamous being the massacres of Differdange and Dudelange, as well as the destruction of the abbeys of Clairefontaine, Echternach and Orval.[61][62] However the Fortress of Luxembourg resisted for nearly 7 months before the Austrian forces holding it surrendered. Luxembourg\\'s long defense led Lazare Carnot to call Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city\\'s nickname the Gibraltar of the North.[63]\\nLuxembourg was annexed by France, becoming the département des forêts (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a département into France was formalised at the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797.[63]\\nFrom the start of the occupation the new French officials in Luxembourg, who spoke only French, implemented many republican reforms, among them the principle of laicism, which led to an outcry in strongly Catholic Luxembourg. Additionally French was implemented as the only official language and Luxembourgish people were barred access to all civil services.[64] When the French Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion.[64] Even though the French managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called Klëppelkrich, it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.[65]\\nHowever, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on Luxembourg; one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic Code Civil which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.[66]\\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Duchy of Luxembourg was restored. However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian Netherlands in the past, both the Kingdom of Prussia and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands now claimed possession of the territory. At the Congress of Vienna the great powers decided that Luxembourg would become a member state of the newly formed German Confederation, but at the same time William I of the Netherlands, the King of the Netherlands, would become, in personal union, the head of state. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only the Fortress of Luxembourg be manned by Prussian troops, but also that large parts of Luxembourgish territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) become Prussian possessions.[67] This marked the second time that the Duchy of Luxembourg was reduced in size, and is generally known as the Second Partition of Luxembourg. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a Grand-Duchy, thus giving the Dutch monarchs the additional title of Grand-Duke of Luxembourg.\\nAfter Belgium became an independent country following the victorious Belgian Revolution of 1830–1831, it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as being part of Belgium, however, the Dutch King who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, as well as Prussia, did not want to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of Luxembourg and did not agree with the Belgian claims.[68] The dispute would be solved at the 1839 Treaty of London where the decision of the Third Partition of Luxembourg was taken. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country (but also the then Luxembourgish-speaking part of Arelerland) was transferred to the new state of Belgium, thereby giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.[69][70][71][72]\\nIn 1842 Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (Zollverein).[73][74] This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of Luxembourg\\'s steel industry, and expansion of Luxembourg\\'s railway network from 1855 to 1875.\\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over Luxembourg and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy\\'s independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the Second Treaty of London and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of Luxembourg under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year.[75] At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Luxembourg\\'s neutrality was respected, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.[76][77]\\nAs a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of Luxembourg gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century.[78] The people of Luxembourg began referring to themselves as Luxembourgers, rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn (“We want to remain what we are ”) culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the Dutch monarchy ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, the Grand-Duchy would have their own monarchy, thus reaffirming its full independence.[79]\\nIn August 1914, during World War I, Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg\\'s neutrality by invading it in order to defeat France. Nevertheless, despite the German occupation, Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms.[80] Unaware of the fact that Germany secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a German victory (the Septemberprogramm), the Luxembourgish government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the Luxembourgish population did not believe Germany had good intentions, fearing that it would annex Luxembourg. Around 3,700 Luxembourgers served in the French army, of whom 2,000 died.[81] Their sacrifices have been commemorated at the Gëlle Fra.\\nAfter the war, Grand-Duchess Marie-Adélaïde was seen by many people (including the French and Belgian governments) as having collaborated with the Germans and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder.[82][83] After the retreat of the German army, communists in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette tried to establish a soviet worker\\'s republic similar to the ones emerging in Germany, but these attempts lasted only 2 days.[83][82]\\nIn November 1918, a motion in the Chamber of Deputies demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated narrowly by 21 votes to 19 (with 3 abstentions).[84]\\nFrance questioned the Luxembourgish government\\'s, and especially Marie-Adélaïde\\'s, neutrality during the war, and calls for an annexation of Luxembourg to either France or Belgium grew louder in both countries.[85]\\nIn January 1919, a company of the Luxembourgish Army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but French troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion.[85] Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Adélaïde, who abdicated in favor of her sister Charlotte 5 days later.[86]\\nThe same year, in a popular referendum, 77.8% of the Luxembourgish population declared in favor of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic.\\nDuring this time, Belgium pushed for an annexation of Luxembourg. However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the Paris Peace Conference, thus securing Luxembourg\\'s independence.[87]\\nIn 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, Luxembourg\\'s neutrality was violated again when Nazi Germany\\'s Wehrmacht entered the country, \"entirely without justification\".[88] In contrast to the First World War, under the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II, the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of Nazi Germany, Gau Moselland. This time, Luxembourg did not remain neutral as Luxembourg\\'s government in exile based in London supported the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion, and multiple resistance groups formed inside the occupied country.[89]\\nWith 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in Luxembourg being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the Battle of the Bulge), Luxembourg suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe and its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned.[90] Around 1,000-2,500 of Luxembourg\\'s Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\\nThe Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg\\'s neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of NATO.[91] During the Cold War, Luxembourg continued its involvements on the side of the Western Bloc. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the Korean War.[92]\\nLuxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF.[93]\\nIn the 1950s, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, following the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union. With Robert Schuman (one of the founding fathers of the EU), Pierre Werner (considered the father of the Euro), Gaston Thorn, Jacques Santer and Jean-Claude Juncker (all former Presidents of the European Commission), Luxembourgish politicians contributed substantially to the EU\\'s formation and establishment. In 1999, Luxembourg joined the eurozone. Thereafter, the country was elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (2013–14).\\nThe steel industry exploiting the Red Lands\\' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove Luxembourg\\'s industrialization. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as a global financial center and developed into the banking hub it is reputed to be. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a knowledge economy, with the founding of the University of Luxembourg and a national space program.\\nLuxembourg is described as a \"full democracy\",[94] with a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Executive power is exercised by the grand duke and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers.[95] The Constitution of Luxembourg, the supreme law of Luxembourg, was adopted on 17 October 1868.[96] The grand duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. But since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the nation, exercised by the grand duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law.[97]\\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (Conseil d\\'État), composed of 21 ordinary citizens appointed by the grand duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.[98]\\nLuxembourg has three lower tribunals (justices de paix; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch), and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\\nLuxembourg is divided into 12 cantons, which are further divided into 102 communes.[99] Twelve of the communes have city status; the city of Luxembourg is the largest.[100]\\nLuxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In 1921, Luxembourg and Belgium formed the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create a regime of inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs.[74] Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed).[23] At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.[101]\\nLuxembourg is the site of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg.[102] Luxembourg is also site of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three EFTA members who are part of the European Single Market through the EEA Agreement.[103]\\nThe Luxembourgish army is mostly based in its casern, the Centre militaire Caserne Grand-Duc Jean on the Härebierg in Diekirch. The general staff is based in the capital, the État-Major.[104] The army is under civilian control, with the grand duke as Commander-in-Chief. The Minister for Defense, Yuriko Backes, oversees army operations. The professional head of the army is the Chief of Defense, who answers to the minister and holds the rank of general.\\nBeing landlocked, Luxembourg has no navy. Seventeen NATO AWACS airplanes are registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.[105] In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane.[citation needed]\\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.[106]\\nLuxembourg is one of Europe\\'s smallest countries, ranking 168th in size of the 194 independent countries of the world; it is about 2,586 square kilometers (998\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) in size, measuring 82\\xa0km (51\\xa0mi) long and 57\\xa0km (35\\xa0mi) wide. It lies between latitudes 49° and 51° N, and longitudes 5° and 7° E.[107]\\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesländer of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and to the south, it borders the French région of Grand Est (Lorraine). The Grand Duchy borders Belgium\\'s Wallonia, in particular the Belgian provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\\nThe northern third of the country is known as the Oesling, and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,[108] which is the highest point, at 560 meters (1,840\\xa0ft). Other mountains are the Buurgplaatz at 559 meters (1,834\\xa0ft) near Huldange and the Napoléonsgaard at 554 meters (1,818\\xa0ft) near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than five thousand people.\\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the Gutland, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg\\'s industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg\\'s largest towns.\\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world\\'s best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries.[109] In 2020, it ranked second out of 180 countries.[110] Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer\\'s.[111] The country wants to cut GHG emissions by 55% in 10 years and reach zero emissions by 2050. Luxembourg wants to increase its organic farming fivefold.[112] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.12/10, ranking it 164th globally out of 172 countries.[113]\\nLuxembourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are warm and winters cool.[114]\\nLuxembourg\\'s stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.[115] Unemployment is traditionally low, though it reached 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the 2008 global financial crisis.[116] In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the world\\'s second-richest country, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119.[117] Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019.[118] Luxembourg ranks 13th in The Heritage Foundation\\'s Index of Economic Freedom,[119] 26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit\\'s quality of life index.[120] It ranked 21st in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[121]\\nThe industrial sector, dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During recent decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of the economic output. Luxembourg is the world\\'s second largest investment fund center (after the United States), the most important private banking center in the eurozone and Europe\\'s leading center for reinsurance companies. Moreover, Luxembourg\\'s government has aimed to attract Internet startups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many Internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Other high-tech companies have established themselves in Luxembourg, including 3D scanner developer/manufacturer Artec 3D.[citation needed]\\nIn April 2009, concern about Luxembourg\\'s banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a \"gray list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of \"jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard\".[122][123] In March 2010, the Sunday Telegraph reported that most of Kim Jong-Il\\'s $4 billion in secret accounts was in Luxembourg banks.[124] Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channeling substantial U.K. revenues, as reported by The Guardian in April 2012.[125] Luxembourg ranked third on the Tax Justice Network\\'s 2011 Financial Secrecy Index of the world\\'s major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the Cayman Islands.[126] In 2013, Luxembourg was ranked the 2nd safest tax haven in the world, behind Switzerland.\\nIn early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, Luxembourg\\'s former Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as Luxembourg Leaks—that Luxembourg had turned into a major European center of corporate tax avoidance under his premiership.[127]\\nAgriculture employed about 2.1% of Luxembourg\\'s active population in 2010, when there were 2200 agricultural holdings with an average area per holding of 60 hectares.[128]\\nLuxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.[129]\\nWith $171 billion in May 2015, the country ranked 11th in the world in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.[130] However, securities owned by non-Luxembourg residents, but held in custodial accounts in Luxembourg, are included in this figure.[131]\\nAs of 2019[update], Luxembourg\\'s public debt totaled $15,687,000,000, or $25,554 per capita. The debt to GDP was 22.10%.[132]\\nThe Luxembourg labor market represents 445,000 jobs occupied by 120,000 Luxembourgers, 120,000 foreign residents and 205,000 cross-border commuters. The latter pay their taxes in Luxembourg, but their education and social rights are the responsibility of their country of residence. The same applies to pensioners. Luxembourg\\'s government has never shared its tax revenues with the local authorities on the French border. This system is seen as one of the keys to Luxembourg\\'s economic growth, but at the expense of the border countries.[133]\\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with 165\\xa0km (103\\xa0mi)[134] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city\\'s railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008.[135] Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.[136]\\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg—higher than most of other states, and surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.[137]\\nOn 29 February 2020, Luxembourg became the first country to introduce no-charge public transportation, which will be almost completely funded by public expenditure.[138]\\nThe telecommunications industry in Luxembourg is liberalized and the electronic communications networks are significantly developed. Competition between the different operators is guaranteed by the legislative framework Paquet Telecom[139] of the Government of 2011 which transposes the European Telecom Directives into Luxembourgish law. This encourages the investment in networks and services. The regulator ILR – Institut Luxembourgeois de Régulation[140] ensures the compliance to these legal rules.[citation needed]\\nLuxembourg has modern and widely deployed optical fiber and cable networks throughout the country. In 2010, the Luxembourg Government launched its National strategy for very high-speed networks with the aim to become a global leader in terms of very high-speed broadband by achieving full 1 Gbit/s coverage of the country by 2020.[141] In 2011, Luxembourg had an NGA coverage of 75%.[142] In April 2013 Luxembourg featured the 6th highest download speed worldwide and the 2nd highest in Europe: 32,46 Mbit/s.[143] The country\\'s location in Central Europe, stable economy and low taxes favour the telecommunication industry.[144][145][146]\\nIt ranks 2nd in the world in the development of the Information and Communication Technologies in the ITU ICT Development Index and 8th in the Global Broadband Quality Study 2009 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo.[147][148][149][150]\\nLuxembourg is connected to all major European Internet Exchanges (AMS-IX Amsterdam,[151] DE-CIX Frankfurt,[152] LINX London),[153] datacenters and POPs through redundant optical networks.[154][155][156][157][158] In addition, the country is connected to the virtual meetme room services (vmmr)[159] of the international data hub operator Ancotel.[160] This enables Luxembourg to interconnect with all major telecommunication operators[161] and data carriers worldwide. The interconnection points are in Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong.[162] Luxembourg has established itself as one of the leading financial technology (FinTech) hubs in Europe, with the Luxembourg government supporting initiatives like the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology.[163]\\nSome 20 data centers[164][165][166] are operating in Luxembourg. Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc,[167] two of LuxConnect[168][169] and one of European Data Hub.[170] In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.[171][172]\\nThe people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers.[174] The immigrant population increased in the 20th century due to the arrival of immigrants from Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal; the latter comprised the largest group.  In 2013 about 88,000 Luxembourg inhabitants possessed Portuguese nationality.[175] In 2013, there were 537,039 permanent residents, 44.5% of which were of foreign background or foreign nationals; the largest foreign ethnic groups were the Portuguese, comprising 16.4% of the total population, followed by the French (6.6%), Italians (3.4%), Belgians (3.3%) and Germans (2.3%). Another 6.4% were of other EU background, while the remaining 6.1% were of other non-EU, but largely other European, background.[176]\\nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. In 2000 there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg in 1999.[177]\\nAs determined by law since 1984, Luxembourg has only one national language, Luxembourgish.[13] It is considered the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for Luxembourgers and the language they generally use to speak or write to each other. Luxembourgish as well as the dialects in adjacent Germany belong to the Moselle Franconian subgroup of the main West Central German dialect group, which are largely mutually intelligible across the border, but Luxembourgish also has more than 5,000 words of French origin.[178][179] Knowledge of Luxembourgish is a criterion for naturalisation.[180]\\nIn addition to Luxembourgish, French and German are used in administrative and judicial matters, making all three administrative languages of Luxembourg.[13] Per article 4 of the law promulgated in 1984, if a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.[13]\\nLuxembourg is largely multilingual: as of 2012[update], 52% of citizens claimed Luxembourgish as their native language, 16.4% Portuguese, 16% French, 2% German and 13.6% different languages (mostly English, Italian or Spanish).[181][182] Even though French was the mother tongue of only 16% of residents in Luxembourg (placing 3rd), 98% of its citizens were able to speak it to a high level.[183] The vast majority of Luxembourg residents are able to speak it as a second or third language.[184] As of 2018[update], much of the population was able to speak multiple other languages: 80% of citizens reported being able to hold a conversation in English, 78% in German and 77% in Luxembourgish, claiming these languages as their respective second, third or fourth language.[183]\\nEach of the three official languages is used as a primary language in certain spheres of everyday life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak and write to each other, and there has been a recent[when?] increase in the production of novels and movies in the language; at the same time, the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 44% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other.[185]\\nMost official business and written communication is carried out in French, which is also the language mostly used for public communication, with written official statements, advertising displays and road signs generally in French. Due to the historical influence of the Napoleonic Code on the legal system of the Grand Duchy, French is also the sole language of the legislation and generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. Parliamentary debates are mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas written government communications and official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports, etc.) are drafted mostly in French and sometimes additionally in German.[citation needed]\\nAlthough professional life is largely multilingual, French is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies (56%), followed by Luxembourgish (20%), English (18%), and German (6%).[186]\\nGerman is very often used in much of the media along with French and is considered by most Luxembourgers their second language. This is mostly due to the high similarity of German to Luxembourgish but also because it is the first language taught to children in primary school (language of literacy acquisition).[187]\\nDue to the large community of Portuguese origin, the Portuguese language is fairly prevalent in Luxembourg, though it remains limited to the relationships inside this community. Portuguese has no official status, but the administration sometimes makes certain informative documents available in Portuguese.[citation needed]\\nEven though Luxembourg is largely multilingual today, some people claim that Luxembourg is subject of intense francization and that Luxembourgish and German are in danger of disappearing in the country, making Luxembourg either a unilingual Francophone country, or at best a bilingual French- and English-speaking country sometime in the far future.[188][189][184]\\nLuxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognizes certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Religions covered by such arrangements are Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Mennonitism, and Islam.[190]\\nSince 1980, it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.[191] A 2000 estimate by the CIA Factbook is that 87% of Luxembourgers are Catholic, including the grand ducal family, with the remaining 13% being Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, and those of other or no religion.[192] According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated, and 0.5% other religions.[193]\\nAccording to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll,[194] 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 28% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\", and 22% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\".\\nLuxembourg\\'s education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.[195] Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, but half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged.[196] In addition to the three national languages, English is taught in compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English. The past two decades have highlighted the growing importance of English in several sectors, in particular the financial sector. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large segments of the population, but by relatively few from outside the Portuguese-speaking community.[197]\\nThe University of Luxembourg is the only university based in Luxembourg. In 2014, Luxembourg School of Business, a graduate business school, was created through private initiative and received the accreditation from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg in 2017.[198][199] Two American universities maintain satellite campuses in the country: Miami University (Dolibois European Center) and Sacred Heart University (Luxembourg Campus).[200]\\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation.[201][202] The nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross Domestic Product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010 among other well-off nations in Europe with high average income among its population.[203]\\nLuxembourg has been heavily influenced by the culture of its neighbors. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.[204][unreliable source?]\\nThe country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Théo Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose The Family of Man exhibition has been placed on UNESCO\\'s Memory of the World register, and is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Editor and author Hugo Gernsback, whose publications crystallized the concept of science fiction, was born in Luxembourg City. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.[205]\\nLuxembourg was a founding participant of the Eurovision Song Contest, and participated every year between 1956 and before it was relegated after the 1993 competition, with the exception of 1959. Although Luxembourg was free to participate again in 1995, it chose not to return to the competition before 2024. It has won the competition a total of five times, 1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983 and hosted the contest in 1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984. Only nine of its 38 entries before 2024, and none of its five winning entries, were performed by Luxembourgish artists.[206] On its 2024 return, this was, however, with a particular emphasis on promoting music and artists from Luxembourg.[207]\\nLuxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France.[208] The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.[citation needed]\\nLuxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion.[209][210] The pavilion, designed as a forest and fortress, was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, \"Lúsēnbǎo\", which when directly translated, means \"forest and fortress\". It represented Luxembourg as the \"Green Heart in Europe\".[211]\\nUnlike most countries in Europe, sports in Luxembourg are not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but instead encompass a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of 660,000, are licensed members of one sports federation or another.[212] The Stade de Luxembourg, situated in Gasperich, southern Luxembourg City, is the country\\'s national stadium and largest sports venue in the country with a capacity of 9,386 for sporting events, including football and rugby union, and 15,000 for concerts.[213] The largest indoor venue in the country is d\\'Coque, Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women\\'s European Volleyball Championship.[214]\\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently,[when?] it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.[citation needed]\\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country\\'s folk dishes, the same as in neighboring Germany.[citation needed]\\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.[215] However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.[216]\\nLuxembourg has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita with Japan ranked at number one and Switzerland following Luxembourg at number three.[217]\\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily Luxemburger Wort.[218] Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition, there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.[219]\\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.[220]\\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.[221] There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.[222][223]\\nLuxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 in the Animated Short Films category with Mr Hublot.[224]\\n'),\n",

Known for portraying villains, degenerate gamblers, and authority figures alike,[1] Patrick is a Saturn Award winner with four other nominations.\\nPatrick dropped out of college when drama class sparked his interest in acting, and entered film in 1986. After playing a supporting role in Die Hard 2 (1990), he came to prominence as the T-1000, the antagonist of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)—a role he reprised for cameo appearances in Wayne\\'s World (1992) and Last Action Hero (1993). His other film credits include Fire in the Sky (1993), Striptease (1996), Cop Land (1997), The Faculty (1998), Spy Kids (2001), Charlie\\'s Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Ladder 49 (2004), Walk the Line (2005), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), We Are Marshall (2006), Bridge to Terabithia (2007), The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009), and Safe House (2012).\\nIn television, Patrick played FBI Special Agent John Doggett in The X-Files, Colonel Tom Ryan in The Unit, DHS agent Cabe Gallo in Scorpion, and Auggie Smith / White Dragon in Peacemaker. He has played ongoing roles in series such as 1923, The Outer Limits, The Sopranos, Elvis, Burn Notice, Last Resort, Sons of Anarchy, its spin-off Mayans M.C., Jamie Hawkins in The Night Agent, and From Dusk till Dawn: The Series.\\nAllMovie journalist Tracie Cooper wrote that, by the conclusion of The X-Files in 2002, Patrick had developed a \"solid reputation within the industry\", with critics, fans and co-stars alike praising his \"work ethic, personality, and consistent performances.\"[2] Actor and director Jason Bateman described Patrick as \"one of the great heavies.\"[3]\\nPatrick[4] was born in Marietta, Georgia, on November 5, 1958,[2] and raised there, as well as in Boston, Massachusetts, Dayton, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Bay Village, Ohio. He is the eldest of five children born to Nadine and Robert M. Patrick.[5]\\nPatrick did not start to pursue an acting career until his mid-twenties. During his childhood, he did not like to act. In third grade, Patrick refused to wear a pair of green tights required for Peter Pan.[2] He graduated from Farmington High School in Farmington, Michigan in 1977. Patrick was a track and field and football athlete at Bowling Green State University. He dropped out before graduating when he found an interest in drama and acting.[4] After leaving college, Patrick worked as a house painter and continued as such until a boating accident in 1984 in Lake Erie.[2] He swam for three hours in order to save others still stranded on the accident site, and nearly drowned in doing so.[4] After the accident, he moved to Los Angeles at age 26.\\nPatrick first appeared in several low-budget science-fiction and action films produced by Roger Corman and shot in the Philippines by Cirio H. Santiago.[6] Looking back, he credited his early appearances in films to his \"tough-looking exterior\".[2] He played leading roles in pictures such as Eye of the Eagle, Equalizer 2000 or Future Hunters. Patrick later commented that his experience with Santiago had been his \"film school\". The B movies he made in the Philippines helped him get an SAG card.[6] Patrick\\'s first major Hollywood film was Die Hard 2, in a small part as a henchman for Colonel Stuart, before landing the role of the T-1000, the villain of James Cameron\\'s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron said he chose Patrick because of his physical appearance, which he felt fit the role. Patrick was \"broke\" at the time, living in a cheap apartment with his girlfriend, Barbara, whom he married during shooting. He has credited the film with starting his career.[2][7]\\nAfter Terminator 2, Patrick landed roles in various feature films such as Last Action Hero, Fire in the Sky (both 1993) and Striptease (1996). Because of his fondness for martial arts, Patrick starred in two martial arts films titled Double Dragon and Hong Kong 97, both released in 1994, and even had a fight scene with taekwondo master Hwang Jang-Lee in Future Hunters (1988). His performance in Fire in the Sky led The X-Files creator Chris Carter to cast him in that series for the role of John Doggett. Patrick\\'s brother, Richard, had previously worked for the series by adding music for the soundtrack album The X-Files: The Album. Patrick was cast as Doggett in 2000. The X-Files was canceled two seasons later, after Duchovny left the show following season 7, which resulted in low ratings for the show. Patrick made several appearances on many genre magazines, with TV Guide going so far as to label him one of the Ten Sexiest Men of Sci-Fi.[2]\\nIn 2000, Patrick appeared in three episodes of The Sopranos (\"The Happy Wanderer\", \"Bust Out\" and \"Funhouse\") as David \"Davey\" Scatino, a store owner struggling with gambling debts owed to Richie Aprile and Tony Soprano. Four years later, he made a guest appearance in the pilot episodes for Sci-Fi Channel\\'s original series Stargate Atlantis, \"Rising\", as the military component commander of the Atlantis expedition, Marshall Sumner. He accepted the role, since he had worked with the same crew on The Outer Limits, a series which he appeared in during the early 1990s.[7]\\nPatrick played Johnny Cash\\'s father, Ray Cash, in the film Walk the Line and Elvis\\'s father, Vernon Presley in the miniseries Elvis.[8] In 2003, he appeared in Charlie\\'s Angels: Full Throttle, which reunited him with his Striptease co-star, Demi Moore. He had a regular role on The Unit,[9] and played Elvis Presley in Lonely Street (2009).[10] In October 2006, he starred in the WWE Films production The Marine as Rome.[11] He also appeared in We Are Marshall as Marshall University head coach Rick Tolley, who lost his life when Southern Airways Flight 932 crashed in 1970.[12] His credits also include a guest starring role in the Lost episode \"Outlaws\", as well as a recurring role as the voice of Master Piandao in season 3 of the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Patrick played a supporting role in Firewall, a 2006 action film starring Harrison Ford. He has also appeared in Meat Loaf\\'s music video \"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are\" with Will Estes.[13]\\nDirector McG, who directed Terminator Salvation, said that he wanted to reintroduce characters from the previous Terminator films: \"I like the idea and the perspective for the next picture that you meet Robert Patrick the way he looks today, and he\\'s a scientist that\\'s working on, you know, improving cell replication so we can stay healthier and we can cure diabetes and do all these things that sound like good ideas, and to once again live as idealized expressions as ourselves.\"[14] Patrick also starred in the psychological thriller The Black Water of Echo\\'s Pond, which was directed by Italian filmmaker Gabriel Bologna.[15] In recent years, he has appeared in such television series as Burn Notice, NCIS and True Blood, among others. From 2012 to 2013, he also starred in Last Resort as Chief of the Boat Joseph Prosser. He played a supporting character in Identity Thief (2013).

       " ('Bayonet',\n",
       "  '\\nA bayonet (from French baïonnette) is a knife, dagger, sword, or spike-shaped weapon designed to fit on the end of the muzzle of a rifle, carbine, musket or similar firearm, allowing it to be used as a spear-like weapon.[1]\\nFrom the early 17th to the early 20th century, it was a melee weapon used by infantry for offensive and/or defensive tactics. Today, it is considered an ancillary weapon or  weapon of last resort, although it is still used for ceremonial purposes.\\nThe term bayonette itself dates back to the 16th century, but it is not clear whether bayonets at the time were knives that could be fitted to the ends of firearms, or simply a type of knife. For example, Cotgrave\\'s 1611 Dictionarie describes the bayonet as \"a kind of small flat pocket dagger, furnished with knives; or a great knife to hang at the girdle\". Likewise, Pierre Borel wrote in 1655 that a kind of long-knife called a bayonette was made in Bayonne but does not give any further description.[2] There are some accounts that place the invention of the bayonet in either France or Germany as early as 1570.[3]\\nThe first recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise, Binglu\\xa0[zh] published in 1606. It was in the form of the Son-and-mother gun\\xa0[zh], a breech-loading musket that was issued with a roughly 57.6\\xa0cm (22.7\\xa0in) long plug bayonet, giving it an overall length of 1.92\\xa0m (6\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in) with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a \"gun-blade\" (simplified Chinese: 铳刀; traditional Chinese: 銃刀; pinyin: Chòngdāo) with it being described as a \"short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly\" that it is to be used \"when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against bandits, when forces are closing into melee or encountering an ambush\" and if one \"cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear\".[4][5]\\nEarly bayonets were of the \"plug\" type, where the bayonet was fitted directly into the barrel of the musket.[6][7][8] This allowed light infantry to be converted to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. The first known mention of the use of bayonets in European warfare was in the memoirs of Jacques de Chastenet, Vicomte de Puységur.[9] He described the French using crude 1-foot (0.30\\xa0m) plug bayonets during the Thirty Years\\' War (1618–1648).[9] However, it was not until 1671 that General Jean Martinet standardized and issued plug bayonets to the French regiment of fusiliers then raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment raised in 1672, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685.[10]\\nThe major problem with plug bayonets was that when attached they made it impossible to fire the musket, requiring soldiers to wait until the last possible moment before a melee to fix the bayonet. The defeat of forces loyal to William of Orange by Jacobite Highlanders at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the plug bayonet.[7][10] The Highlanders closed to 50\\xa0yd (46\\xa0m), fired a single volley, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords quickly overwhelmed the loyalists before they had time to fix bayonets. Shortly thereafter, the defeated leader, Hugh Mackay, is believed to have introduced a socket bayonet of his own invention. Soon \"socket\" bayonets would incorporate both socket mounts and an offset blade that fit around the musket\\'s barrel, which allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was attached.\\nAn unsuccessful trial with socket or zigzag bayonets was made after the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, in the presence of King Louis XIV, who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the Peace of Ryswick (1697), the English and Germans abolished the pike and introduced socket bayonets.[10] The British socket bayonet had a spike with a triangular cross-section rather than a flat blade, with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of 15 inches (38\\xa0cm). It had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle, and was well-documented for falling off in the heat of battle.[7]\\nBy the mid-18th century, socket bayonets had been adopted by most European armies. In 1703, the French infantry adopted a spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged model.[11]\\nThe 18th century introduced the concept of the sword bayonet, a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a shortsword. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an infantry square properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the Pattern 1800 Infantry Rifle, later known as the \"Baker Rifle\". Sword bayonets were used by German Jagers in the 18th century. The hilt usually had quillons modified to accommodate the gun barrel and a hilt mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a bayonet lug. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a sidearm, when detached from the musket or rifle. When the bayonet was attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned all  long guns into a spear or glaive, which made it suitable for both thrusting and cutting attacks.\\nWhile the British Army eventually discarded the sword bayonet, the socket bayonet survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system.[7] The new bayonet proved its worth at the Battle of Alma and the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it.[7]\\nIn the 1860s, European nations began to develop new bolt-action breechloading rifles (such as the Chassepot and Snider–Enfield) and sword bayonets suitable for mass production and used by police, pioneer, and engineer troops.[12] The decision to redesign the bayonet into a short sword was viewed by some as an acknowledgement of the decline in importance of the fixed bayonet as a weapon in the face of new advances in firearms technology.[13] As a British newspaper put it, \"the committee, in recommending this new sword bayonet, appear to have had in view the fact that bayonets will henceforth be less frequently used than in former times as a weapon of offence and defence; they desired, therefore, to substitute an instrument of more general utility.\"[13]\\nOne of these multipurpose designs was the \\'sawback\\' bayonet, which incorporated saw teeth on the spine of the blade.[12] The sawback bayonet was intended for use as a general-purpose utility tool as well as a weapon; the teeth were meant to facilitate the cutting of wood for various defensive works such as barbed-wire posts, as well as for butchering livestock.[1][13][14][15] It was initially adopted by the German states in 1865; until the middle of WWI approximately 5% of every bayonet style was complemented with a sawback version, for example in Belgium in 1868, Great Britain in 1869 and Switzerland in 1878 (Switzerland introduced their last model in 1914).[1][13][14][15][16] The original sawback bayonets were typically of the heavy sword-type, they were issued to engineers, with to some extent the bayonet aspect being secondary to the \"tool\" aspect. Later German sawbacks were more of a rank indicator than a functional saw. The sawback proved relatively ineffective as a cutting tool, and was soon outmoded by improvements in military logistics and transportation; most nations dropped the sawback feature by the early 20th century.[1] The German army discontinued use of the sawback bayonet in 1917 after protests that the serrated blade caused unnecessarily severe wounds when used as a fixed bayonet.[1][15]\\nThe trowel or spade bayonet was another multipurpose design, intended for use both as an offensive weapon as well as a digging tool for excavating entrenchments.[17][18] In 1870, the US Army issued trowel bayonets to infantry regiments based on a design by Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Rice, a US Army officer and Civil War veteran, which were manufactured by the Springfield Armory.[19] Besides its utility as both a fixed bayonet and a digging implement, the Rice trowel bayonet could be used to plaster log huts and stone chimneys for winter quarters; sharpened on one edge, it could cut tent poles and pins.[19] Ten thousand were eventually issued, and the design saw service during the 1877 Nez Perce campaign.[20] Rice was given leave in 1877 to demonstrate his trowel bayonet to several nations in Europe.[20] One infantry officer recommended it to the exclusion of all other designs, noting that \"the entrenching  [sic] tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed.\"[19] The Rice trowel bayonet was declared obsolete by the US Army in December 1881.[20]\\nPrior to World War I, bayonet doctrine was largely founded upon the concept of \"reach\"; that is, a soldier\\'s theoretical ability, by use of an extremely long rifle and fixed bayonet, to stab an enemy soldier without having to approach within reach of his opponent\\'s blade.[1][21][22] A combined length of rifle and bayonet longer than that of the enemy infantryman\\'s rifle and attached bayonet, like the infantryman\\'s pike of bygone days, was thought to impart a tactical advantage on the battlefield.[1][22][23][24]\\nIn 1886, the French army introduced a 52-centimetre-long (20.5\\xa0in) quadrangular épée spike for the bayonet of the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, the Épée-Baïonnette Modèle 1886, resulting in a rifle and bayonet with an overall length of six feet (1.8\\xa0m). Germany responded by introducing a long sword bayonet for the Model 1898 Mauser rifle, which had a 29-inch barrel. The bayonet, the Seitengewehr 98, had a 50\\xa0cm (19.7-inch) blade.[23] With an overall length of 5\\xa0feet 9\\xa0inches (1.75\\xa0m), the German army\\'s rifle/bayonet combination was second only to the French Lebel for overall \\'reach\\'.[23]\\nAfter 1900, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States adopted rifles with barrel lengths shorter than that of a rifled musket, but longer than that of a carbine.[1][25] These were intended for general use by infantry and cavalry.[25] The \"reach\" of the new short rifles with attached bayonets was reduced.[1] Britain introduced the shortened Lee–Enfield rifle, the SMLE, in 1904.[1][25] The German M1898 Mauser rifle and attached sword bayonet was 20\\xa0cm (eight inches) longer than the SMLE and its P1903 bayonet, which used a twelve-inch (30\\xa0cm) blade.[1][26] While the British P1903 and its similar predecessor, the P1888, was satisfactory in service, criticism soon arose regarding the shortened reach.[1][23][25][27] One military writer of the day warned: \"The German soldier has eight inches the better of the argument over the British soldier when it comes to crossing bayonets, and the extra eight inches easily turns the battle in favour of the longer, if both men are of equal skill.\"[23]\\nIn 1905, the German Army adopted a shortened 37-centimetre-long (14.5\\xa0in) bayonet, the Seitengewehr 98/06 for engineer and pioneer troops, and in 1908, a short rifle as well, the Karabiner Model 1898AZ, which was produced in limited quantities for the cavalry, artillery, and other specialist troops.[28] However, the long-barreled 98 Mauser rifle remained in service as the primary infantry small arm.[29] Moreover, German military authorities continued to promote the idea of outreaching one\\'s opponent on the battlefield by means of a longer rifle/bayonet combination, a concept prominently featured in its infantry bayonet training doctrines.[24] These included the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack.[30] Using this tactic, the German soldier dropped into a half-crouch, with the rifle and fixed bayonet held close to the body.[30] In this position the soldier next propelled his rifle forward, then dropped the supporting hand while taking a step forward with the right foot, simultaneously thrusting out the right arm to full length with the extended rifle held in the grip of the right hand alone.[30] With a maximum \\'kill zone\\' of some eleven feet, the throw point bayonet attack gave an impressive increase in \\'reach\\', and was later adopted by other military forces, including the U.S. Army.[30][31]\\nIn response to criticism over the reduced reach of the SMLE rifle and bayonet, British ordnance authorities introduced the P1907 bayonet in 1908, which had an elongated blade of some seventeen inches to compensate for the reduced overall length of the SMLE rifle.[1][22][25][32][33] The 1907 bayonet was essentially a copy of the Japanese Type 30 bayonet, Britain having purchased a number of Japanese type 30 rifles for the Royal Navy during the preceding years.[34] U.S. authorities in turn adopted a long (16-in. blade) bayonet for the M1903 Springfield short rifle, the M1905 bayonet; later, a long sword bayonet was also provided for the M1917 Enfield rifle.[27]\\nThe experience of World War I reversed opinion on the value of long rifles and bayonets in typical infantry combat operations.[26][33][35][36] Whether in the close confines of trench warfare, night time raiding and patrolling, or attacking across open ground, soldiers of both sides soon recognized the inherent limitations of a long and ungainly rifle and bayonet when used as a close-quarters battle weapon.[26][33][35][36] Once Allied soldiers had been trained to expect the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack, the method lost most of its tactical value on the World War I battlefield.[30] It required a strong arm and wrist, was very slow to recover if the initial thrust missed its mark, and was easily parried by a soldier who was trained to expect it, thus exposing the German soldier to a return thrust which he could not easily block or parry.[30][37][38] Instead of longer bayonets, infantry forces on both sides began experimenting with other weapons as auxiliary close-quarter arms, including the trench knife, trench club, handgun, hand grenade, and entrenching tool.[35][39]\\nSoldiers soon began employing the bayonet as a knife as well as an attachment for the rifle, and bayonets were often shortened officially or unofficially to make them more versatile and easier to use as tools, or to maneuver in close quarters.[1][33][35][36] During World War II, bayonets were further shortened into knife-sized weapons in order to give them additional utility as fighting or utility knives.[1] The vast majority of modern bayonets introduced since World War II are of the knife bayonet type.[1]\\nThe development of the bayonet from the 17th century onwards led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry tactic throughout the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century. As early as the 19th century, military scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.[40]\\nThe bayonet charge was above all a tool of shock. While charges were reasonably common in 18th and 19th century warfare, actual combat between formations with their bayonets was so rare as to be effectively nonexistent. Usually, a charge would only happen after a long exchange of gunfire, and one side would break and run before contact was actually made. Sir Charles Oman, nearing the end of his history of the Peninsular War (1807–1814) in which he had closely studied hundreds of battles and combats, only discovered a single example of, in his words, \"one of the rarest things in the Peninsular War, a real hand-to-hand fight with the white weapon.\" Infantry melees were much more common in close country – towns, villages, earthworks and other terrain which reduced visibility to such ranges that hand-to-hand fighting was unavoidable. These melees, however, were not bayonet charges per se, as they were not executed or defended against by regular bodies of orderly infantry; rather, they were a chaotic series of individual combats where musket butts and fists were used alongside bayonets, swords, and polearms.[41]\\nThe bayonet charge was a common tactic used during the Napoleonic wars. Despite its effectiveness, a bayonet charge did not necessarily cause substantial casualties through the use of the weapon itself. Detailed battle casualty lists from the 18th century showed that in many battles, less than 2% of all wounds treated were caused by bayonets.[42] Antoine-Henri Jomini, a celebrated military author who served in numerous armies during the Napoleonic period, stated that the majority of bayonet charges in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contact was made. Combat with bayonets did occur, but mostly on a small scale when units of opposing sides encountered each other in a confined environment, such as during the storming of fortifications or during ambush skirmishes in broken terrain.[43] In an age of fire by massed volley, when compared to random unseen bullets, the threat of the bayonet was much more tangible and immediate – guaranteed to lead to a personal gruesome conclusion if both sides persisted. All this encouraged men to flee before the lines met. Thus, the bayonet was an immensely useful weapon for capturing ground from the enemy, despite seldom actually being used to inflict wounds.\\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865) the bayonet was found to be responsible for less than 1% of battlefield casualties,[44] a hallmark of modern warfare. The use of bayonet charges to force the enemy to retreat was very successful in numerous small unit engagements at short range in the American Civil War, as most troops would retreat when charged while reloading. Although such charges inflicted few casualties, they often decided short engagements, and tactical possession of important defensive ground features. Additionally, bayonet drill could be used to rally men temporarily unnerved by enemy fire.[45]\\nWhile the overall Battle of Gettysburg was won by the Union armies due to a combination of terrain and massed artillery fire, a decisive point on the second day of the battle hinged on a bayonet charge at Little Round Top when Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain\\'s 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, running short of musket ammunition, charged downhill, surprising and capturing many of the surviving soldiers of the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment and other Confederate regiments. Other bayonet charges occurred at Gettysburg, such as that of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment. This was ordered in desperation by General Hancock earlier on July 2 in order to delay a Confederate brigade\\'s advance long enough to bring up reinforcements for the holed Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Still another bayonet charge was conducted late in the evening on July 2 by the 137th New York Infantry Regiment defending the extreme right flank of the Union line on Culp\\'s Hill. The charge of several companies managed to temporarily stall the advance of the 10th Virginia Infantry Regiment long enough for the 14th Brooklyn to move in on the 137th\\'s right and repel the attack.\\nThe popular image of World War I combat is of a wave of soldiers with bayonets fixed, \"going over the top\" and charging across no man\\'s land into a hail of enemy fire. Although this was the standard method of fighting early in the war, it was rarely successful. British casualties on the first day of the Battle of the Somme were the worst in the history of the British army, with 57,470 British casualties, 19,240 of whom were killed.[46][47]\\nDuring World War I, no man\\'s land was often hundreds of yards across.[48] The area was usually devastated by the warfare and riddled with craters from artillery and mortar shells, and sometimes contaminated by chemical weapons. Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often covered with barbed wire and land mines, and littered with the rotting corpses of those who were not able to make it across the sea of projectiles, explosions, and flames. A bayonet charge through no man\\'s land often resulted in the total annihilation of entire battalions.\\nThe advent of modern warfare in the 20th century made bayonet charges dubious affairs. During the Siege of Port Arthur (1904–1905), the Japanese used suicidal human wave attacks against Russian artillery and machine guns,[49] suffering massive casualties.[50] One description of the aftermath was that a \"thick, unbroken mass of corpses covered the cold earth like a [carpet]\".[51]\\nHowever, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese were able to effectively use bayonet charges against poorly organized and lightly armed Chinese troops. \"Banzai charges\" became an accepted military tactic where Japanese forces were able to routinely rout larger Chinese forces.[52]\\nIn the early stages of the Pacific War (1941–1945), a sudden banzai charge might overwhelm small groups of enemy soldiers unprepared for such an attack. But, by the end of the war, against well organized and heavily armed Allied forces, a banzai charge inflicted little damage while its participants suffered horrendous losses. At best, they were conducted as a last resort by small groups of surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost. At worst, they wasted valuable resources in men and weapons, which hastened defeat.\\nSome Japanese commanders, such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the Battle of Iwo Jima.[53][54]\\nThe term \"human wave attack\" was often misused to describe the Chinese short attack[55]—a combination of infiltration and the shock tactics employed by the People\\'s Liberation Army during the Korean War (1950–1953).[56] A typical Chinese short attack was carried out at night by sending a series of small five-man fireteams to attack the weakest point of an enemy\\'s defenses.[56] The Chinese assault team would crawl undetected within grenade range, then launch surprise attacks with fixed bayonets against the defenders in order to breach the defenses by relying on maximum shock and confusion.[56]\\nIf the initial shock failed to breach the defenses, additional fireteams would press on behind them and attack the same point until a breach was created.[56] Once penetration was achieved, the bulk of the Chinese forces would move into the enemy rear and attack from behind.[57] Due to primitive communication systems and tight political controls within the Chinese army, short attacks were often repeated until either the defenses were penetrated or the attackers were completely annihilated.[56]\\nThis persistent attack pattern left a strong impression on UN forces that fought in Korea, giving birth to the description of \"human wave\".[58] The term \"human wave\" was later used by journalists and military officials to convey the image of the American soldiers being assaulted by overwhelming numbers of Chinese on a broad front, which is inaccurate when compared with the normal Chinese practice of sending successive series of small teams against a weak point in the line.[59] It was in fact rare for the Chinese to actually use densely concentrated infantry formations to absorb enemy firepower.[60]\\nOne use the Germans in World War II made of bayonets was to search for people in hiding. One person hiding in a house in the Netherlands wrote: \"The Germans made lots of noise as they came upstairs, and they stabbed their bayonets into the wall. Then what we\\'d always feared actually happened:  A bayonet went through the thin wallpaper above the closet, exposing the three people who were hiding there. \\'Raus!\\' cried the Germans. \\'Out!\\'\".[61]\\nDuring the Korean War, the French Battalion and Turkish Brigade used bayonet charges against enemy combatants.[62] In 1951, United States Army officer Lewis L. Millett led soldiers of the US Army\\'s 27th Infantry Regiment in taking out a machine gun position with bayonets. Historian S. L. A. Marshall described the attack as \"the most complete bayonet charge by American troops since Cold Harbor\". Out of about 50 enemy dead, roughly 20 were found to have been killed by bayonets, and the location subsequently became known as Bayonet Hill.[63] This was the last bayonet charge by the US Army. For his leadership during the assault, Millett was awarded the Medal of Honor. The medal was formally presented to him by President Harry S. Truman in July 1951.[64] He was also awarded the Army\\'s second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross, for leading another bayonet charge in the same month.[65]\\nOn 23 October 1962, 20 Indian soldiers led by Joginder Singh would fix bayonets and charge a force of 200 Chinese soldiers. While the charge would prove futile for Singh and his men, it initially threw the Chinese off guard and forced a retreat despite outnumbering them 10-1.[citation needed]\\nOn 8 May 1970, New Mexico Governor David Cargo dispatched \"truckloads\" of National Guardsmen to the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque in response to demonstrations by hundreds of students. The demonstrators were protesting the continued war in Vietnam, the recent extension of the war into Cambodia, and the Kent State Killings of four students four days earlier, on 4 May, by Ohio National Guardsmen at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. The Guardsmen at UNM were armed with bayonets fixed on their rifles and attacked the students with those bayonets, injuring eleven, leaving some with serious injuries.[66]\\nIn 1982, the British Army mounted bayonet charges during the Falklands War, notably the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Mount Longdon and the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards during the final assault of Mount Tumbledown.[citation needed]\\nIn 1995, during the Siege of Sarajevo, French Marine infantrymen from the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment carried out a bayonet charge against the Serbian forces at the Battle of Vrbanja bridge.[67] Actions led by the regiment allowed the United Nations blue helmets to exit from a passive position due to a first time engagement in hostile responses. Two fatalities resulted from this event with seventeen others wounded.\\nDuring the Second Gulf War and the war in Afghanistan, British Army units mounted several bayonet charges.[68] In 2004, at the Battle of Danny Boy in Iraq, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders bayonet-charged mortar positions filled with over 100 Mahdi Army members. The ensuing hand-to-hand fighting resulted in an estimate of over 40 insurgents killed and 35 bodies collected (many floated down the river) and nine prisoners. Sergeant Brian Wood, of the Princess of Wales\\'s Royal Regiment, was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle.[69]\\nIn 2009, Lieutenant James Adamson of the Royal Regiment of Scotland was awarded the Military Cross for a bayonet charge while on a tour of duty in Afghanistan: after shooting one Taliban fighter dead, Adamson had run out of ammunition when another enemy appeared. He immediately charged the second Taliban fighter and bayoneted him.[70] In September 2012, Lance Corporal Sean Jones of The Princess of Wales\\'s Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his role in a bayonet charge which took place in October 2011.[71][72]\\nToday, the bayonet is rarely used in one-to-one combat.[73][74][75] Despite its limitations, many modern assault rifles (including bullpup designs) retain a bayonet lug and the bayonet is issued by many armies. The bayonet is used for controlling prisoners, or as a weapon of last resort.[73] In addition, some authorities have concluded that the bayonet serves as a useful training aid in building morale and increasing desired aggressiveness in troops.[76][77]\\nToday\\'s bayonets often double as multi-purpose utility knives, bottle openers or other tools. Issuing one modern multi-purpose bayonet/knife is also more cost effective than issuing separate specialty bayonets, and field/combat knives.\\nThe original AK-47 has an adequate but unremarkable bayonet. However, the AKM Type I bayonet (introduced in 1959) was an improvement of the original design.[78] It has a Bowie style (clip-point) blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose survival knife and wire-cutter when combined with its steel scabbard.[78][79] The AK-74 bayonet 6Kh5 (introduced in 1983) represents a further refinement of the AKM bayonet. \"It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge.\"[78] The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece moulded plastic grip, making it a more effective fighting knife.[78] It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter.[78] The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire.\\nThe American M16 rifle used the M7 bayonet which is based on earlier designs such as the M4, M5 and M6 models, all of which are direct descendants of the M3 Fighting Knife and have a spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 has a clip-point blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. It can even be used by troops to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines\\' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.\\nThe AK-47 was adopted by Communist China as the Type 56 assault rifle and includes an integral folding spike bayonet, similar to the SKS rifle.[80] Some Type 56s may also use the AKM Type II bayonet.[80][81] The latest Chinese rifle, the QBZ-95, has a multi-purpose knife bayonet similar to the US M9.\\nThe FN FAL has two types of bayonet. The first is a traditional spear point bayonet. The second is the Type C socket bayonet introduced in the 1960s.[82] It has a hollow handle that fits over the muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the FALs 22\\xa0mm NATO-spec flash hider.[82] Its spear-type blade is offset to the side of the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade.[82]\\nThe current British L3A1 socket bayonet is based on the FN FAL Type C socket bayonet with a clip-point blade.[83] It has a hollow handle that fits over the SA80/L85 rifle\\'s muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the flash eliminator. The blade is offset to the side of the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard.[73] The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade.[73] The use of contemporary bayonets by the British army was noted during the Afghanistan war in 2004.[72]\\nThe H&K G3 rifle uses two types of bayonets, both of which is mounted above the G3\\'s rifle barrel.[84] The first is the standard G3 bayonet which has a blade similar to the American M7 bayonet.[84] The second is an Eickhorn KCB-70 type multi-purpose knife bayonet, featuring a clip-point with saw-back, a wire-cutter scabbard and a distinctive squared handgrip.[84] For the H&K G36 there was little use of modified AKM type II knife bayonets from stocks of the former Nationale Volksarmee (National People\\'s Army) of East Germany. The original muzzle-ring was cut away and a new, large diameter muzzle ring welded in place. The original leather belt hanger was replaced by a complex web and plastic belt hanger designed to fit the West German load bearing equipment.[85]\\nThe Steyr AUG uses two types of bayonet. The first and most common is an Eickhorn KCB-70 type multi-purpose bayonet with an M16 bayonet type interface. The second are the Glock Feldmesser 78 (Field Knife 78) and the Feldmesser 81 (Survival Knife 81), which can also be used as a bayonet, by engaging a socket in the pommel (covered by a plastic cap) into a bayonet adapter that can be fitted to the AUG rifle.[86][87][88] These bayonets are noteworthy, as they were meant to be used primarily as field or survival knives and use as a bayonet was a secondary consideration. They can also be used as throwing knives and have a built-in bottle opener in the crossguard.[89][90]\\nThe French use a more traditional spear point bayonet with the current FAMAS bayonet which is nearly identical to that of the M1949/56 bayonet.[91] The new French H&K 416F rifle uses the Eickhorn \"SG 2000 WC-F\", a multi-purpose combat knife/bayonet (similar to the KM2000) with a wire cutter.[92] It weighs 320\\xa0g (0.7\\xa0lb), is 30.0\\xa0cm (11.8\\xa0in) long with a half serrated 17.3\\xa0cm (6.8\\xa0in) blade for cutting through ropes.[92] The synthetic handle and sheath have electrical insulation that protects up to 10,000 volts. The sheath also has a diamond blade sharpener.\\nThe push-twist motion of fastening the older type of spike bayonet has given a name to:\\nIn chess, an aggressive variation of the King\\'s Indian Defence is known as the \"Bayonet Attack\".\\nThe bayonet has become a symbol of military power. The term \"at the point of a bayonet\" refers to using military force or action to accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. Bayonet Constitution). Undertaking a task \"with fixed bayonets\" has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics.\\nThe Australian Army \\'Rising Sun\\' badge features a semicircle of bayonets. The Australian Army Infantry Combat Badge (ICB) takes the form of a vertically mounted Australian Army SLR (7.62mm self-loading rifle FN FAL) bayonet surrounded by an oval-shaped laurel wreath.[94]\\nThe US Army Combat Action Badge, awarded to personnel who have come under fire since 2001 and who are not eligible for the Combat Infantryman Badge (due to the fact that only Infantry personnel may be awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge), has a bayonet as its central motif. The shoulder sleeve insignia for the 10th Mountain Division in the US Army features crossed bayonets. The US Army\\'s 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team\\'s shoulder patch features a bayonet wrapped in a wing, symbolizing their airborne status. The brigade regularly deploys in task forces under the name \"Bayonet\".\\nThe insignia of the British Army\\'s School of Infantry is an SA80 bayonet against a red shield. It is worn as a Tactical recognition flash (TRF) by instructors at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick, the Infantry Battle School at Brecon and the Support Weapons School in Warminster. Fixed bayonets also feature on the cap badge and tactical recognition flash of the Small Arms School Corps.\\nThe vocation tab collar insignia for the Singapore Armed Forces Infantry Formation utilizes two crossed bayonets. The bayonet is often used as a symbol of the Infantry in Singapore.\\n'),\n",

There are also numerous regional Romance languages. By most measures, Sardinian and Italian are the least divergent Romance languages from Latin, whereas French has changed the most.[5]\\nThere are more than 900 million native speakers of Romance languages found worldwide, mainly in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Africa. Portuguese, French and Spanish also have many non-native speakers and are in widespread use as linguae francae.[6]\\nThe various Romance-speaking peoples, usually those of Latin Europe and Latin America, have sometimes been collectively referred to as Romance peoples, Latin peoples, or Romanic peoples.[7][8][9]\\nThe term Romance derives from the Vulgar Latin adverb romanice, \"in Roman\", derived from romanicus: for instance, in the expression romanice loqui, \"to speak in Roman\" (that is, the Latin vernacular), contrasted with latine loqui, \"to speak in Latin\" (Medieval Latin, the conservative version of the language used in writing and formal contexts or as a lingua franca), and with barbarice loqui, \"to speak in Barbarian\" (the non-Latin languages of the peoples living outside the Roman Empire).[10] From this adverb the noun romance originated, which applied initially to anything written romanice, or \"in the Roman vernacular\".[11]\\nMost of the Romance-speaking area in Europe has traditionally been a dialect continuum, where the speech variety of a location differs only slightly from that of a neighboring location, but over a longer distance these differences can accumulate to the point where two remote locations speak what may be unambiguously characterized as separate languages. This makes drawing language boundaries difficult, and as such there is no unambiguous way to divide the Romance varieties into individual languages. Even the criterion of mutual intelligibility can become ambiguous when it comes to determining whether two language varieties belong to the same language or not.[12]\\nThe following is a list of groupings of Romance languages, with some languages and dialects chosen to exemplify each grouping. These groupings should not be interpreted as well-separated genetic clades in a tree model:\\nThe Romance language most widely spoken natively today is Spanish, followed by Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian, which together cover a vast territory in Europe and beyond, and work as official and national languages in dozens of countries.[13]\\nIn Europe, at least one Romance language is official in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Romania, Moldova, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Vatican City. In these countries, French, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Romansh and Catalan have constitutional official status.\\nFrench, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Romanian are also official languages of the European Union.[14] Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, and Catalan were the official languages of the defunct Latin Union;[15] and French and Spanish are two of the six official languages of the United Nations.[16] Outside Europe, French, Portuguese and Spanish are spoken and enjoy official status in various countries that emerged from the respective colonial empires.[17][18][19]\\nSpanish is an official language in Spain and in nine countries of South America, home to about half that continent\\'s population; in six countries of Central America (all except Belize); and in Mexico. In the Caribbean, it is official in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. In all these countries, Latin American Spanish is the vernacular language of the majority of the population, giving Spanish the most native speakers of any Romance language. In Africa it is one of the official languages of Equatorial Guinea. Spanish was one of the official languages in the Philippines in Southeast Asia until 1973.  During the 1987 constitution, Spanish was de-listed as an official language(replaced with English), and was listed as an optional/voluntary language along with Arabic. It is currently spoken by a minority and taught in the school curriculum.\\nPortuguese, in its original homeland, Portugal, is spoken by virtually the entire population of 10 million. As the official language of Brazil, it is spoken by more than 200 million people in that country, as well as by neighboring residents of eastern Paraguay and northern Uruguay, accounting for a little more than half the population of South America, thus making Portuguese the most spoken official Romance language in a single country. It is the official language of six African countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea, and São Tomé and Príncipe), and is spoken as a native language by perhaps 16 million residents of that continent.[20][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed] In Asia, Portuguese is co-official with other languages in East Timor and Macau, while most Portuguese-speakers in Asia—some 400,000[21]—are in Japan due to return immigration of Japanese Brazilians. In North America 1,000,000 people speak Portuguese as their home language.[22]\\nIn Oceania, Portuguese is the second most spoken Romance language, after French, due mainly to the number of speakers in East Timor. Its closest relative, Galician, has official status in the autonomous community of Galicia in Spain, together with Spanish.[citation needed]\\nOutside Europe, French is spoken natively most in the Canadian province of Quebec, and in parts of New Brunswick and Ontario. Canada is officially bilingual, with French and English being the official languages. In parts of the Caribbean, such as Haiti, French has official status, but most people speak creoles such as Haitian Creole as their native language. French also has official status in much of Africa, with relatively few native speakers but larger numbers of second language speakers. French is spoken by around 300 to 450 million people in 2022 according to Ethnologue and the OIF.[23][24] In Europe, French is spoken by 71 million native speakers and nearly 200 million Europeans can speak French, making French the second most spoken language in Europe after English.[25] French is also the second most studied language in the world behind English, with about 130 million learners in 2017.[26]\\nAlthough Italy also had some colonial possessions before World War II, its language did not remain official after the end of the colonial domination. As a result, Italian outside of Italy and Switzerland is now spoken only as a minority language by immigrant communities in North and South America and Australia. In some former Italian colonies in Africa—namely Libya, Eritrea and Somalia—it is spoken by a few educated people in commerce and government.[citation needed]\\nRomania did not establish a colonial empire. The native range of Romanian includes not only the Republic of Moldova, where it is the dominant language and spoken by a majority of the population, but neighboring areas in Serbia (Vojvodina and the Bor District), Bulgaria, Hungary, and Ukraine (Bukovina, Budjak) and in some villages between the Dniester and Bug rivers.[27] As with Italian, Romanian is spoken outside of its ethnic range by immigrant communities. In Europe, Romanian-speakers form about two percent of the population in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Romanian is also spoken in Israel by Romanian Jews,[28] where it is the native language of five percent of the population,[29] and is spoken by many more as a secondary language. The Aromanian language is spoken today by Aromanians in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, and Greece.[30]\\nThe total of 880 million native speakers of Romance languages (ca. 2020) are divided as follows:[23]\\nCatalan is the official language of Andorra. In Spain, it is co-official with Spanish in Catalonia, the Valencian Community (under the name Valencian), and the Balearic Islands, and it is recognized, but not official, in an area of Aragon known as La Franja. In addition, it is spoken by many residents of Alghero, on the island of Sardinia, and it is co-official in that city. Galician, with more than a million native speakers, is official together with Spanish in Galicia, and has legal recognition in neighbouring territories in Castilla y León. A few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, Asturian and Aragonese in Spain; Mirandese in Portugal; Friulian, Sardinian and Franco-Provençal in Italy; and Romansh in Switzerland.[This paragraph needs citation(s)]\\nThe remaining Romance languages survive mostly as spoken languages for informal contact. National governments have historically viewed linguistic diversity as an economic, administrative or military liability, as well as a potential source of separatist movements; therefore, they have generally fought to eliminate it, by extensively promoting the use of the official language, restricting the use of the other languages in the media, recognizing them as mere \"dialects\", or even persecuting them. As a result, all of these languages are considered endangered to varying degrees according to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, ranging from \"vulnerable\" (e.g. Sicilian and Venetian) to \"severely endangered\" (Franco-Provençal, most of the Occitan varieties). Since the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, increased sensitivity to the rights of minorities has allowed some of these languages to start recovering their prestige and lost rights. Yet it is unclear whether these political changes will be enough to reverse the decline of minority Romance languages.[This paragraph needs citation(s)]\\nRomance languages are the continuation of Vulgar Latin, the popular and colloquial sociolect of Latin spoken by soldiers, settlers, and merchants of the Roman Empire, as distinguished from the classical form of the language spoken by the Roman upper classes, the form in which the language was generally written.[31] Between 350 BC and 150 AD, the expansion of the Empire, together with its administrative and educational policies, made Latin the dominant native language in continental Western Europe. Latin also exerted a strong influence in southeastern Britain, the Roman province of Africa, western Germany, Pannonia and the whole Balkans.[citation needed]\\nDuring the Empire\\'s decline, and after its fragmentation and the collapse of its Western half in the fifth and sixth centuries, the spoken varieties of Latin became more isolated from each other, with the western dialects coming under heavy Germanic influence (the Goths and Franks in particular) and the eastern dialects coming under Slavic influence.[32][33] The dialects diverged from classical Latin at an accelerated rate and eventually evolved into a continuum of recognizably different typologies. The colonial empires established by Portugal, Spain, and France from the fifteenth century onward spread their languages to the other continents to such an extent that about two-thirds of all Romance language speakers today live outside Europe.[citation needed]\\nDespite other influences (e.g. substratum from pre-Roman languages, especially Continental Celtic languages; and superstratum from later Germanic or Slavic invasions), the phonology, morphology, and lexicon of all Romance languages consist mainly of evolved forms of Vulgar Latin. However, some notable differences occur between today\\'s Romance languages and their Roman ancestor. With only one or two exceptions, Romance languages have lost the declension system of Latin and, as a result, have SVO sentence structure and make extensive use of prepositions.[34]\\nBy some measures, Sardinian and Italian are the least divergent languages from Latin, while French has changed the most.[35] However, all Romance languages are closer to each other than to classical Latin.[36][37]\\nDocumentary evidence about Vulgar Latin for the purposes of comprehensive research is limited, and the literature is often hard to interpret or generalize. Many of its speakers were soldiers, slaves, displaced peoples, and forced resettlers, and more likely to be natives of conquered lands than natives of Rome. In Western Europe, Latin gradually replaced Celtic and other Italic languages, which were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.[39][40][41]\\nVulgar Latin is believed to already have had most of the shared features that distinguish all Romance languages from Classical Latin. These include  the almost complete loss of the Latin grammatical case system and its replacement by prepositions, the loss of the comparative inflections, replacement of some verb paradigms by innovations (e.g. the synthetic future gave way to an originally analytic strategy now typically formed by infinitive + evolved present indicative forms of \\'have\\'), the use of articles, and the initial stages of the palatalization of the plosives /k/, /ɡ/, and /t/.[This paragraph needs citation(s)]\\nTo some scholars, this suggests the form of Vulgar Latin that evolved into the Romance languages was around during the time of the Roman Empire (from the end of the first century BC), and was spoken alongside the written Classical Latin which was reserved for official and formal occasions. Other scholars argue that the distinctions are more rightly viewed as indicative of sociolinguistic and register differences normally found within any language. With the rise of the Roman Empire, Vulgar Latin spread first throughout Italy and then through southern, western, central, and southeastern Europe, and northern Africa along parts of western Asia.[42]:\\u200a1\\u200a\\nVulgar and Classical Latin were mutually intelligible as one and the same language until very approximately the second half of the 7th century. After that time and within two hundred years, Latin became a dead language since \"the Romanized people of Europe could no longer understand texts that were read aloud or recited to them.\"[43] Latin had ceased to be a first language and became a foreign language that had to be learned, if the label Latin is constrained to refer to a state of the language frozen in past time and restricted to linguistic features for the most part typical of higher registers.\\nDuring the political decline of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, there were large-scale migrations into the empire, and the Latin-speaking world was fragmented into several independent states. Central Europe and the Balkans were occupied by Germanic and Slavic tribes, as well as by Huns. These incursions isolated the Vlachs from the rest of Romance-speaking Europe.[This paragraph needs citation(s)] Nevertheless, as linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, Romanian \"retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right\", even without taking into account the \"re-Romancing tendency\" during its recent history.[44]\\nBritish and African Romance—the forms of Vulgar Latin used in Britain and the Roman province of Africa, where it had been spoken by much of the urban population—disappeared in the Middle Ages (as did Pannonian Romance in what is now Hungary, and Moselle Romance in Germany). But the Germanic tribes that had penetrated Roman Italy, Gaul, and Hispania eventually adopted Latin/Romance and the remnants of the culture of ancient Rome alongside existing inhabitants of those regions, and so Latin remained the dominant language there. In part due to regional dialects of the Latin language and local environments, several languages evolved from it.[42]:\\u200a4\\u200a\\nMeanwhile, large-scale migrations into the Eastern Roman Empire started with the Goths and continued with Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs, Pechenegs, Hungarians and Cumans. The invasions of Slavs were the most thoroughgoing, and they partially reduced the Romanic element in the Balkans.[45]\\nThe invasion of the Turks and conquest of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the empire. The Slavs named the Romance-speaking population Vlachs, while the latter called themselves \"Rumân\" or \"Român\", from the Latin \"Romanus\".[46] The Daco-Roman dialect became fully distinct from the three dialects spoken South of the Danube—Aromanian, Istro-Romanian, and Megleno-Romanian—during the ninth and tenth centuries, when the Romanians (sometimes called Vlachs or Wallachians) emerged as a people.[47]\\nOver the course of the fourth to eighth centuries, local changes in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon accumulated to the point that the speech of any locale was noticeably different from another. In principle, differences between any two lects increased the more they were separated geographically, reducing easy mutual intelligibility between speakers of distant communities.[48] Clear evidence of some levels of change is found in the Reichenau Glosses, an eighth-century compilation of about 1,200 words from the fourth-century Vulgate of Jerome that had changed in phonological form or were no longer normally used, along with their eighth-century equivalents in proto-Franco-Provençal. The following are some examples with reflexes in several modern Romance languages for comparison:\\nIn all of the above examples, the words appearing in the fourth century Vulgate are the same words as would have been used in Classical Latin of c. 50 BC. It is likely that some of these words had already disappeared from casual speech by the time of the Glosses; but if so, they may well have been still widely understood, as there is no recorded evidence that the common people of the time had difficulty understanding the language.\\nBy the 8th century, the situation was very different. During the late 8th century, Charlemagne, holding that \"Latin of his age was by classical standards intolerably corrupt\",[48]:\\u200a6\\u200a successfully imposed Classical Latin as an artificial written vernacular for Western Europe. Unfortunately, this meant that parishioners could no longer understand the sermons of their priests, forcing the Council of Tours in 813 to issue an edict that priests needed to translate their speeches into the rustica romana lingua, an explicit acknowledgement of the reality of the Romance languages as separate languages from Latin.[48]:\\u200a6\\u200a\\nBy this time, and possibly as early as the 6th century according to Price (1984),[48]:\\u200a6\\u200a the Romance lects had split apart enough to be able to speak of separate Gallo-Romance, Ibero-Romance, Italo-Romance and Eastern Romance languages. Some researchers[who?] have postulated that the major divergences in the spoken dialects began or accelerated considerably in the 5th century, as the formerly widespread and efficient communication networks of the Western Roman Empire rapidly broke down, leading to the total disappearance of the Western Roman Empire by the end of the century. The critical period between the 5th–10th centuries AD is poorly documented because little or no writing from the chaotic \"Dark Ages\" of the 5th–8th centuries has survived, and writing after that time was in consciously classicized Medieval Latin, with vernacular writing only beginning in earnest in the 11th or 12th century. An exception such as the Oaths of Strasbourg is evidence that by the ninth century effective communication with a non-learnèd audience was carried out in evolved Romance.[citation needed]\\nA language that was closely related to medieval Romanian was spoken during the Dark Ages by Vlachs in the Balkans, Herzegovina, Dalmatia (Morlachs), Ukraine (Hutsuls), Poland (Gorals), Slovakia, and Czech Moravia, but gradually these communities (except for the Vlachs) lost their maternal language.[52]\\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries, some local vernaculars developed a written form and began to supplant Latin in many of its roles. In some countries, such as Portugal, this transition was expedited by force of law; whereas in others, such as Italy, many prominent poets and writers used the vernacular of their own accord – some of the most famous in Italy being Giacomo da Lentini and Dante Alighieri. Well before that, the vernacular was also used for practical purposes, such as the testimonies in the Placiti Cassinesi, written 960–963.\\nLexical and grammatical similarities among the Romance languages, and between Latin and each of them, are apparent from the following examples in various Romance lects, all meaning \\'She always closes the window before she dines/before dining\\'.\\nSome of the divergence comes from semantic change: where the same root words have developed different meanings. For example, the Portuguese word fresta is descended from Latin fenestra \"window\" (and is thus cognate to French fenêtre, Italian finestra, Romanian fereastră and so on), but now means \"skylight\" and \"slit\". Cognates may exist but have become rare, such as hiniestra in Spanish, or dropped out of use entirely. The Spanish and Portuguese terms defenestrar meaning \"to throw through a window\" and fenestrado meaning \"replete with windows\" also have the same root, but are later borrowings from Latin.\\nLikewise, Portuguese also has the word cear, a cognate of Italian cenare and Spanish cenar, but uses it in the sense of \"to have a late supper\" in most varieties, while the preferred word for \"to dine\" is jantar (related to archaic Spanish yantar \"to eat\") because of semantic changes in the 19th century. Galician has both fiestra (from medieval fẽestra, the ancestor of standard Portuguese fresta) and the less frequently used ventá and xanela.\\nAs an alternative to lei (originally the genitive form), Italian has the pronoun ella, a cognate of the other words for \"she\", but it is hardly ever used in speaking.\\nSpanish, Asturian, and Leonese ventana and Mirandese and Sardinian bentana come from Latin ventus \"wind\" (cf. English window, etymologically \\'wind eye\\'), and Portuguese janela, Galician xanela, Mirandese jinela from Latin *ianuella \"small opening\", a derivative of ianua \"door\".\\nSardinian balcone (alternative for ventàna/bentàna) comes from Old Italian and is similar to other Romance languages such as French balcon (from Italian balcone), Portuguese balcão, Romanian balcon, Spanish balcón, Catalan balcó and Corsican balconi (alternative for purtellu).\\nThe classification of the Romance languages is inherently difficult, because most of the linguistic area is a dialect continuum, and in some cases political biases can come into play. Along with Latin (which itself is not included among the Romance languages as it is the direct ancestor of Romance languages) and a few extinct languages of ancient Italy, they make up the Italic branch of the Indo-European family.[12] Most classification schemes are, implicitly or not, historical and geographic, resulting in groupings such as Ibero- and Gallo-Romance. A major division can be drawn between Eastern and Western Romance, separated by the La Spezia-Rimini line. The classification of certain languages is always problematic and ambiguous. A tree model is often used, but the selection of criteria results in different trees. Some other classifications can involve ranking languages according to the degree of differentiation from Latin; by most measures, French is the most highly differentiated Romance language, although Romanian has changed the greatest amount of its vocabulary, while Italian[54][55][56] and Sardinian have changed the least. Standard Italian can be considered a \"central\" language, which is generally somewhat easy to understand to speakers of other Romance languages, whereas French and Romanian are peripheral and quite dissimilar from the rest of Romance.[12]\\nThere are various schemes used to subdivide the Romance languages. Three of the most common schemes are as follows:\\nThe main subfamilies that have been proposed by Ethnologue within the various classification schemes for Romance languages are:\\nThis three-way division is made primarily based on the outcome of Vulgar Latin (Proto-Romance) vowels:\\nItalo-Western is in turn split along the so-called La Spezia–Rimini Line in northern Italy, which divides the central and southern Italian languages from the so-called Western Romance languages to the north and west. The primary characteristics dividing the two are:\\nThe reality is somewhat more complex. All of the \"southeast\" characteristics apply to all languages southeast of the line, and all of the \"northwest\" characteristics apply to all languages in France and (most of) Spain. However, the Gallo-Italic languages are somewhere in between. All of these languages do have the \"northwest\" characteristics of lenition and loss of gemination. However:\\nOn top of this, the medieval Mozarabic language in southern Spain, at the far end of the \"northwest\" group, may have had the \"southeast\" characteristics of lack of lenition and palatalization of /k/ to /tʃ/. Certain languages around the Pyrenees (e.g. some highland Aragonese dialects) also lack lenition, and northern French dialects such as Norman and Picard have palatalization of /k/ to /tʃ/ (although this is possibly an independent, secondary development, since /k/ between vowels, i.e. when subject to lenition, developed to /dz/ rather than /dʒ/, as would be expected for a primary development).\\nThe usual solution to these issues is to create various nested subgroups. Western Romance is split into the Gallo-Iberian languages, in which lenition happens and which include nearly all the Western Romance languages, and the Pyrenean-Mozarabic group,[citation needed] which includes the remaining languages without lenition (and is unlikely to be a valid clade; probably at least two clades, one for Mozarabic and one for Pyrenean). Gallo-Iberian is split in turn into the Iberian languages (e.g. Spanish and Portuguese), and the larger Gallo-Romance languages (stretching from eastern Spain to northeast Italy).\\nProbably a more accurate description, however, would be to say that there was a focal point of innovation located in central France, from which a series of innovations spread out as areal changes. The La Spezia–Rimini Line represents the farthest point to the southeast that these innovations reached, corresponding to the northern chain of the Apennine Mountains, which cuts straight across northern Italy and forms a major geographic barrier to further language spread.\\nThis would explain why some of the \"northwest\" features (almost all of which can be characterized as innovations) end at differing points in northern Italy, and why some of the languages in geographically remote parts of Spain (in the south, and high in the Pyrenees) are lacking some of these features. It also explains why the languages in France (especially standard French) seem to have innovated earlier and more extensively than other Western Romance languages.\\nMany of the \"southeast\" features also apply to the Eastern Romance languages (particularly, Romanian), despite the geographic discontinuity. Examples are lack of lenition, maintenance of intertonic vowels, use of vowel-changing plurals, and palatalization of /k/ to /tʃ/. This has led some researchers, following Walther von Wartburg, to postulate a basic two-way east–west division, with the \"Eastern\" languages including Romanian and central and southern Italian, although this view is troubled by the contrast of numerous Romanian phonological developments with those found in Italy below the La Spezia-Rimini line. Among these features, in Romanian geminates reduced historically to single units, and /kt/ developed into /pt/, whereas in central and southern Italy geminates are preserved and /kt/ underwent assimilation to /tt/.[59]\\nDespite being the first Romance language to diverge from spoken Latin,[31] Sardinian does not fit at all into this sort of division.[60] It is clear that Sardinian became linguistically independent from the remainder of the Romance languages at an extremely early date, possibly already by the first century BC.[61] Sardinian contains a large number of archaic features, including total lack of palatalization of /k/ and /ɡ/ and a large amount of vocabulary preserved nowhere else, including some items already archaic by the time of Classical Latin (first century BC). Sardinian has plurals in /s/ but post-vocalic lenition of voiceless consonants is normally limited to the status of an allophonic rule, which ignores word boundaries (e.g. [k]ane \\'dog\\' but su [ɡ]ane or su [ɣ]ane \\'the dog\\'), and there are a few innovations unseen elsewhere, such as a change of /au/ to /a/. Use of su < ipsum as an article is a retained archaic feature that also exists in the Catalan of the Balearic Islands and that used to be more widespread in Occitano-Romance, and is known as article salat\\xa0[ca] (literally the \"salted article\"), while Sardinian shares develarisation of earlier /kw/ and /ɡw/ with Romanian: Sard. abba, Rum. apă \\'water\\'; Sard. limba, Rom. limbă \\'language\\' (cf. Italian acqua, lingua).\\nThe Sardinian-type vowel system is also found in a small region belonging to the Lausberg area (also known as Lausberg zone; compare Neapolitan language §\\xa0Distribution) of southern Italy, in southern Basilicata, and there is evidence that the Romanian-type \"compromise\" vowel system was once characteristic of most of southern Italy,[62] although it is now limited to a small area in western Basilicata centered on the Castelmezzano dialect, the area being known as Vorposten, the German word for \\'outpost\\'. The Sicilian vowel system, now generally thought to be a development based on the Italo-Western system, is also represented in southern Italy, in southern Cilento, Calabria and the southern tip of Apulia, and may have been more widespread in the past.[63]\\nThe greatest variety of vowel systems outside of southern Italy is found in Corsica, where the Italo-Western type is represented in most of the north and center and the Sardinian type in the south, as well as a system resembling the Sicilian vowel system (and even more closely the Carovignese system) in the Cap Corse region; finally, in between the Italo-Western and Sardinian system is found, in the Taravo region, a unique vowel system that cannot be derived from any other system, which has reflexes like Sardinian for the most part, but the short high vowels of Latin are uniquely reflected as mid-low vowels.[64]\\nGallo-Romance can be divided into the following subgroups:\\nThe following groups are also sometimes considered part of Gallo-Romance:\\nThe Gallo-Romance languages are generally considered the most innovative (least conservative) among the Romance languages. Characteristic Gallo-Romance features generally developed earliest and appear in their most extreme manifestation in the Langue d\\'oïl, gradually spreading out along riverways and transalpine roads.\\nIn some ways, however, the Gallo-Romance languages are conservative. The older stages of many of the languages preserved a two-case system consisting of nominative and oblique, fully marked on nouns, adjectives and determiners, inherited almost directly from the Latin nominative and accusative and preserving a number of different declensional classes and irregular forms. The languages closest to the oïl epicenter preserve the case system the best, while languages at the periphery lose it early.\\nNotable characteristics of the Gallo-Romance languages are:\\nSome Romance languages have developed varieties which seem dramatically restructured as to their grammars or to be mixtures with other languages. There are several dozens of creoles of French, Spanish, and Portuguese origin, some of them spoken as national languages and lingua franca in former European colonies.\\nCreoles of French:\\nCreoles of Spanish:\\nCreoles of Portuguese:\\nLatin and the Romance languages have also served as the inspiration and basis of numerous auxiliary and constructed languages, so-called \"Neo-Romance languages\".[65][66]\\nThe concept was first developed in 1903 by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano, under the title Latino sine flexione.[67] He wanted to create a naturalistic international language, as opposed to an autonomous constructed language like Esperanto or Volapük which were designed for maximal simplicity of lexicon and derivation of words. Peano used Latin as the base of his language because, as he described it, Latin had been the international scientific language until the end of the 18th century.[67][68]\\nOther languages developed include Idiom Neutral (1902), Interlingue-Occidental (1922), Interlingua (1951) and Lingua Franca Nova (1998). The most famous and successful of these is Interlingua.[citation needed] Each of these languages has attempted to varying degrees to achieve a pseudo-Latin vocabulary as common as possible to living Romance languages. Some languages have been constructed specifically for communication among speakers of Romance languages, the Pan-Romance languages.\\nThere are also languages created for artistic purposes only, such as Talossan. Because Latin is a very well attested ancient language, some amateur linguists have even constructed Romance languages that mirror real languages that developed from other ancestral languages. These include Brithenig (which mirrors Welsh), Breathanach[69] (mirrors Irish), Wenedyk (mirrors Polish), Þrjótrunn (mirrors Icelandic),[70] and Helvetian (mirrors German).[71]\\nThe invention of the printing press brought a tendency towards greater uniformity of standard languages within political boundaries, at the expense of other Romance languages and dialects less favored politically. In France, for instance, the dialect spoken in the region of Paris gradually spread to the entire country, and the Occitan of the south lost ground.\\nSignificant sound changes affected the consonants of the Romance languages.\\nThere was a tendency to eliminate final consonants in Vulgar Latin, either by dropping them (apocope) or adding a vowel after them (epenthesis).\\nMany final consonants were rare, occurring only in certain prepositions (e.g. ad \"towards\", apud \"at, near (a person)\"), conjunctions (sed \"but\"), demonstratives (e.g. illud \"that (over there)\", hoc \"this\"), and nominative singular noun forms, especially of neuter nouns (e.g. lac \"milk\", mel \"honey\", cor \"heart\"). Many of these prepositions and conjunctions were replaced by others, while the nouns were regularized into forms based on their oblique stems that avoided the final consonants (e.g. *lacte, *mele, *core).\\nFinal -m was dropped in Vulgar Latin.[72] Even in Classical Latin, final -am, -em, -um (inflectional suffixes of the accusative case) were often elided in poetic meter, suggesting the m was weakly pronounced, probably marking the nasalisation of the vowel before it. This nasal vowel lost its nasalization in the Romance languages except in monosyllables, where it became /n/ e.g. Spanish quien < quem \"whom\",[72] French rien \"anything\" < rem \"thing\";[73] note especially French and Catalan mon < meum \"my (m.sg.)\" which are derived from monosyllabic /meu̯m/ > */meu̯n/, /mun/, whereas Spanish disyllabic mío and Portuguese and Catalan monosyllabic meu are derived from disyllabic /ˈme.um/ > */ˈmeo/.[citation needed]\\nAs a result, only the following final consonants occurred in Vulgar Latin:\\nFinal -t was eventually lost in many languages, although this often occurred several centuries after the Vulgar Latin period. For example, the reflex of -t was dropped in Old French and Old Spanish only around 1100. In Old French, this occurred only when a vowel still preceded the t (generally /ə/ < Latin a). Hence amat \"he loves\" > Old French aime but venit \"he comes\" > Old French vient: the /t/ was never dropped and survives into Modern French in liaison, e.g. vient-il? \"is he coming?\" /vjɛ̃ti(l)/ (the corresponding /t/ in aime-t-il? is analogical, not inherited). Old French also kept the third-person plural ending -nt intact.\\nIn Italo-Romance and the Eastern Romance languages, eventually all final consonants were either lost or protected by an epenthetic vowel, except for some articles and a few monosyllabic prepositions con, per, in. Modern Standard Italian still has very few consonant-final words, although Romanian has resurfaced them through later loss of final /u/ and /i/. For example, amās \"you love\" > ame > Italian ami; amant \"they love\" > *aman > Ital. amano. On the evidence of \"sloppily written\" Lombardic language documents, however, the loss of final /s/ in northern Italy did not occur until the 7th or 8th century, after the Vulgar Latin period, and the presence of many former final consonants is betrayed by the syntactic gemination (raddoppiamento sintattico) that they trigger. It is also thought that after a long vowel /s/ became /j/ rather than simply disappearing: nōs > noi \"we\", se(d)ēs > sei \"you are\", crās > crai \"tomorrow\" (southern Italy). In unstressed syllables, the resulting diphthongs were simplified: canēs > /ˈkanej/ > cani \"dogs\"; amīcās > /aˈmikaj/ > amiche /aˈmike/ \"(female) friends\", where nominative amīcae should produce **amice rather than amiche (note masculine amīcī > amici not **amichi).\\nCentral Western Romance languages eventually regained a large number of final consonants through the general loss of final /e/ and /o/, e.g. Catalan llet \"milk\" < lactem, foc \"fire\" < focum, peix \"fish\" < piscem. In French, most of these secondary final consonants (as well as primary ones) were lost before around 1700, but tertiary final consonants later arose through the loss of /ə/ < -a. Hence masculine frīgidum \"cold\" > Old French freit /frwεt/ > froid /fʁwa/, feminine frīgidam > Old French freide /frwεdə/ > froide /fʁwad/.\\nIn Romance languages palatalization is used to describe the phonetic evolution of velar stops preceding a front vowel and of consonant clusters involving yod or of the palatal approximant itself.[75] The process involving gestural blending and articulatory reinforcement, starting from Late Latin and Early Romance, generated a new series of consonants in Romance languages.[76]\\nStop consonants shifted by lenition in Vulgar Latin in some areas.\\nThe voiced labial consonants /b/ and /w/ (represented by ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩, respectively) both developed a fricative [β] as an intervocalic allophone.[77] This is clear from the orthography; in medieval times, the spelling of a consonantal ⟨v⟩ is often used for what had been a ⟨b⟩ in Classical Latin, or the two spellings were used interchangeably. In many Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, etc.), this fricative later developed into a /v/; but in others (Spanish, Galician, some Catalan and Occitan dialects, etc.) reflexes of /b/ and /w/ simply merged into a single phoneme.[78]\\nSeveral other consonants were \"softened\" in intervocalic position in Western Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Northern Italian), but normally not phonemically in the rest of Italy (except some cases of \"elegant\" or Ecclesiastical words), nor apparently at all in Romanian. The dividing line between the two sets of dialects is called the La Spezia–Rimini Line and is one of the most important isogloss bundles of the Romance dialects.[79] The changes (instances of diachronic lenition resulting in phonological restructuring) are as follows:\\nSingle voiceless plosives became voiced: -p-, -t-, -c- > -b-, -d-, -g-. Subsequently, in some languages they were further weakened, either becoming fricatives or approximants, [β̞], [ð̞], [ɣ˕] (as in Spanish) or disappearing entirely (such as /t/ and /k/ lost between vowels in French, but /p/ > /v/). The following example shows progressive weakening of original /t/: e.g. vītam > Italian vita [ˈviːta], Portuguese vida [ˈvidɐ] (European Portuguese [ˈviðɐ]), Spanish vida [ˈbiða] (Southern Peninsular Spanish [ˈbi.a]), and French vie [vi]. Some scholars have speculated that these sound changes may be due in part to the influence of Continental Celtic languages,[80] while scholarship of the past few decades has proposed internal motivations.[81]\\nThe sound /h/ was lost but later reintroduced into individual Romance languages. The so-called h aspiré \"aspirated h\" in French, now completely silent, was a borrowing from Frankish. In Spanish, word-initial /f/ changed to /h/ during its Medieval stage and was lost afterwards (for example farina > harina).[82] Romanian acquired it most likely from the adstrate.[83]\\nConsonant length is no longer phonemically distinctive in most Romance languages. However some languages of Italy (Italian, Sardinian, Sicilian, and numerous other varieties of central and southern Italy) do have long consonants like /bb/, /dd/, /ɡɡ/, /pp/, /tt/, /kk/, /ll/, /mm/, /nn/, /rr/, /ss/, etc., where the doubling indicates either actual length or, in the case of plosives and affricates, a short hold before the consonant is released, in many cases with distinctive lexical value: e.g. note /ˈnɔte/ (notes) vs. notte /ˈnɔtte/ (night), cade /ˈkade/ (s/he, it falls) vs. cadde /ˈkadde/ (s/he, it fell), caro /ˈkaro/ (dear, expensive) vs. carro /ˈkarro/ (cart, car). They may even occur at the beginning of words in Romanesco, Neapolitan, Sicilian and other southern varieties, and are occasionally indicated in writing, e.g. Sicilian cchiù (more), and ccà (here). In general, the consonants /b/, /ts/, and /dz/ are long at the start of a word, while the archiphoneme |R|[dubious  – discuss] is realised as a trill /r/ in the same position. In much of central and southern Italy, the affricates /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ weaken synchronically to fricative [ʃ] and [ʒ] between vowels, while their geminate congeners do not, e.g. cacio /ˈkatʃo/ → [ˈkaːʃo] (cheese) vs. caccio /ˈkattʃo/ → [ˈkattʃo] (I chase). In Italian the geminates /ʃʃ/, /ɲɲ/, and /ʎʎ/ are pronounced as long [ʃʃ], [ɲɲ], and [ʎʎ] between vowels, but normally reduced to short following pause: lasciare \\'let, leave\\' or la sciarpa \\'the scarf\\' with [ʃʃ], but post-pausal sciarpa with [ʃ].\\nA few languages have regained secondary geminate consonants. The double consonants of Piedmontese exist only after stressed /ə/, written ë, and are not etymological: vëdde (Latin vidēre, to see), sëcca (Latin sicca, dry, feminine of sech). In standard Catalan and Occitan, there exists a geminate sound /lː/ written l·l (Catalan) or ll (Occitan), but it is usually pronounced as a simple sound in colloquial (and even some formal) speech in both languages.\\nIn Late Latin a prosthetic vowel /i/ (lowered to /e/ in most languages) was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with /s/ (referred to as s impura) and a voiceless consonant (#sC- > isC-):[84]\\nWhile Western Romance words fused the prosthetic vowel with the word, cognates in Eastern Romance and southern Italo-Romance did not, e.g. Italian scrivere, spada, spirito, Stefano, and stato, Romanian scrie, spată, spirit, Ștefan and stat. In Italian, syllabification rules were preserved instead by vowel-final articles, thus feminine spada as la spada, but instead of rendering the masculine *il stato, lo stato came to be the norm. Though receding at present, Italian once had a prosthetic /i/ maintaining /s/ syllable-final if a consonant preceded such clusters, so that \\'in Switzerland\\' was in [i]Svizzera. Some speakers still use the prothetic [i] productively, and it is fossilized in a few set locutions such as in ispecie \\'especially\\' or per iscritto \\'in writing\\' (a form whose survival may have been buttressed in part by the word iscritto < Latin īnscrīptus).\\nOne profound change that affected Vulgar Latin was the reorganisation of its vowel system.[85] Classical Latin had five short vowels, ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ, and five long vowels, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, each of which was an individual phoneme (see the table in the right, for their likely pronunciation in IPA), and four diphthongs, ae, oe, au and eu (five according to some authors, including ui). There were also long and short versions of y, representing the rounded vowel /y(ː)/ in Greek borrowings, which however probably came to be pronounced /i(ː)/ even before Romance vowel changes started.\\nThere is evidence that in the imperial period all the short vowels except a differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts.[86] So, for example ē was pronounced close-mid /eː/ while ĕ was pronounced open-mid /ɛ/, and ī was pronounced close /iː/ while ĭ was pronounced near-close /ɪ/.\\nDuring the Proto-Romance period, phonemic length distinctions were lost. Vowels came to be automatically pronounced long in stressed, open syllables (i.e. when followed by only one consonant), and pronounced short everywhere else. This situation is still maintained in modern Italian: cade [ˈkaːde] \"he falls\" vs. cadde [ˈkadde] \"he fell\".\\nThe Proto-Romance loss of phonemic length originally produced a system with nine different quality distinctions in monophthongs, where only original /a aː/ had merged.[87] Soon, however, many of these vowels coalesced:\\nFurther variants are found in southern Italy and Corsica, which also boasts a completely distinct system (see above).\\nThe Proto-Romance allophonic vowel-length system was rephonemicized in the Gallo-Romance languages as a result of the loss of many final vowels. Some northern Italian languages (e.g. Friulian) still maintain this secondary phonemic length, but most languages dropped it by either diphthongizing or shortening the new long vowels.\\nFrench phonemicized a third vowel length system around AD 1300 as a result of the sound change /VsC/ > /VhC/ > /VːC/ (where V is any vowel and C any consonant). This vowel length began to be lost in Early Modern French, but the long vowels are still usually marked with a circumflex (and continue to be distinguished regionally, chiefly in Belgium). A fourth vowel length system, still non-phonemic, has now arisen: All nasal vowels as well as the oral vowels /ɑ o ø/ (which mostly derive from former long vowels) are pronounced long in all stressed closed syllables, and all vowels are pronounced long in syllables closed by the voiced fricatives /v z ʒ ʁ vʁ/. This system in turn has been phonemicized in some varieties (e.g. Haitian Creole), as a result of the loss of final /ʁ/.\\nThe Latin diphthongs ae and oe, pronounced /aj/ and /oj/ in earlier Latin, were early on monophthongized.[89]\\nae became /ɛː/ by the 1st century a.d. at the latest. Although this sound was still distinct from all existing vowels, the neutralization of Latin vowel length eventually caused its merger with /ɛ/ < short e: e.g. caelum \"sky\" > French ciel, Spanish/Italian cielo, Portuguese céu /sɛw/, with the same vowel as in mele \"honey\" > French/Spanish miel, Italian miele, Portuguese mel /mɛl/. Some words show an early merger of ae with /eː/, as in praeda \"booty\" > *prēda /preːda/ > French proie (vs. expected **priée), Italian preda (not **prieda) \"prey\"; or faenum \"hay\" > *fēnum [feːnũ] > Spanish heno, French foin (but Italian fieno /fjɛno/).\\noe generally merged with /eː/: poenam \"punishment\" > Romance */pena/ > Spanish/Italian pena, French peine; foedus \"ugly\" > Romance */fedo/ > Spanish feo, Portuguese feio. There are relatively few such outcomes, since oe was rare in Classical Latin (most original instances had become Classical ū, as in Old Latin oinos \"one\" > Classical ūnus[90]) and so oe was mostly limited to Greek loanwords, which were typically learned (high-register) terms.\\nau merged with ō /oː/ in the popular speech of Rome already by the 1st century b.c.[citation needed] A number of authors remarked on this explicitly, e.g. Cicero\\'s taunt that the populist politician Publius Clodius Pulcher had changed his name from Claudius to ingratiate himself with the masses. This change never penetrated far from Rome, however, and the pronunciation /au/ was maintained for centuries in the vast majority of Latin-speaking areas, although it eventually developed into some variety of o in many languages. For example, Italian and French have /ɔ/ as the usual reflex, but this post-dates diphthongization of /ɔ/ and the French-specific palatalization /ka/ > /tʃa/ (hence causa > French chose, Italian cosa /kɔza/ not **cuosa). Spanish has /o/, but Portuguese spelling maintains ⟨ou⟩, which has developed to /o/ (and still remains as /ou/ in some dialects, and /oi/ in others).[91] Occitan, Romanian, southern Italian languages, and many other minority Romance languages still have /au/. A few common words, however, show an early merger with ō /oː/, evidently reflecting a generalization of the popular Roman pronunciation: e.g. French queue, Italian coda /koda/, Occitan co(d)a, Romanian coadă (all meaning \"tail\") must all derive from cōda rather than Classical cauda (but notice Portuguese cauda).[92] Similarly, Spanish oreja, Portuguese orelha, French oreille, Romanian ureche, and Sardinian olícra, orícla \"ear\" must derive from ōric(u)la rather than Classical auris (Occitan aurelha was probably influenced by the unrelated ausir < audīre \"to hear\"), and the form oricla is in fact reflected in the Appendix Probi.\\nAn early process that operated in all Romance languages to varying degrees was metaphony (vowel mutation), conceptually similar to the umlaut process so characteristic of the Germanic languages. Depending on the language, certain stressed vowels were raised (or sometimes diphthongized) either by a final /i/ or /u/ or by a directly following /j/. Metaphony is most extensive in the Italo-Romance languages, and applies to nearly all languages in Italy; however, it is absent from Tuscan, and hence from standard Italian. In many languages affected by metaphony, a distinction exists between final /u/ (from most cases of Latin -um) and final /o/ (from Latin -ō, -ud and some cases of -um, esp. masculine \"mass\" nouns), and only the former triggers metaphony.\\nSome examples:\\nA number of languages diphthongized some of the free vowels, especially the open-mid vowels /ɛ ɔ/:\\nThese diphthongizations had the effect of reducing or eliminating the distinctions between open-mid and close-mid vowels in many languages. In Spanish and Romanian, all open-mid vowels were diphthongized, and the distinction disappeared entirely. Portuguese is the most conservative in this respect, keeping the seven-vowel system more or less unchanged (but with changes in particular circumstances, e.g. due to metaphony). Other than before palatalized consonants, Catalan keeps /ɔ o/ intact, but /ɛ e/ split in a complex fashion into /ɛ e ə/ and then coalesced again in the standard dialect (Eastern Catalan) in such a way that most original /ɛ e/ have reversed their quality to become /e ɛ/.\\nIn French and Italian, the distinction between open-mid and close-mid vowels occurred only in closed syllables. Standard Italian more or less maintains this. In French, /e/ and /ɛ/ merged by the twelfth century or so, and the distinction between /ɔ/ and /o/ was eliminated without merging by the sound changes /u/ > /y/, /o/ > /u/. Generally this led to a situation where both [e,o] and [ɛ,ɔ] occur allophonically, with the close-mid vowels in open syllables and the open-mid vowels in closed syllables. In French, both [e/ɛ] and [o/ɔ] were partly rephonemicized: Both /e/ and /ɛ/ occur in open syllables as a result of /aj/ > /ɛ/, and both /o/ and /ɔ/ occur in closed syllables as a result of /al/ > /au/ > /o/.\\nOld French also had numerous falling diphthongs resulting from diphthongization before palatal consonants or from a fronted /j/ originally following palatal consonants in Proto-Romance or later: e.g. pācem /patsʲe/ \"peace\" > PWR */padzʲe/ (lenition) > OF paiz /pajts/; *punctum \"point\" > Gallo-Romance */ponʲto/ > */pojɲto/ (fronting) > OF point /põjnt/. During the Old French period, preconsonantal /l/ [ɫ] vocalized to /w/, producing many new falling diphthongs: e.g. dulcem \"sweet\" > PWR */doltsʲe/ > OF dolz /duɫts/ > douz /duts/; fallet \"fails, is deficient\" > OF falt > faut \"is needed\"; bellus \"beautiful\" > OF bels [bɛɫs] > beaus [bɛaws]. By the end of the Middle French period, all falling diphthongs either monophthongized or switched to rising diphthongs: proto-OF /aj ɛj jɛj ej jej wɔj oj uj al ɛl el il ɔl ol ul/ > early OF /aj ɛj i ej yj oj yj aw ɛaw ew i ɔw ow y/ > modern spelling ⟨ai ei i oi ui oi ui au eau eu i ou ou u⟩ > mod. French /ɛ ɛ i wa ɥi wa ɥi o o ø i u u y/.\\nIn both French and Portuguese, nasal vowels eventually developed from sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant (/m/ or /n/). Originally, all vowels in both languages were nasalized before any nasal consonants, and nasal consonants not immediately followed by a vowel were eventually dropped. In French, nasal vowels before remaining nasal consonants were subsequently denasalized, but not before causing the vowels to lower somewhat, e.g. dōnat \"he gives\" > OF dune /dunə/ > donne /dɔn/, fēminam > femme /fam/. Other vowels remained nasalized, and were dramatically lowered: fīnem \"end\" > fin /fɛ̃/ (often pronounced [fæ̃]); linguam \"tongue\" > langue /lɑ̃ɡ/; ūnum \"one\" > un /œ̃/, /ɛ̃/.\\nIn Portuguese, /n/ between vowels was dropped, and the resulting hiatus eliminated through vowel contraction of various sorts, often producing diphthongs: manum, *manōs > PWR *manu, ˈmanos \"hand(s)\" > mão, mãos /mɐ̃w̃, mɐ̃w̃s/; canem, canēs \"dog(s)\" > PWR *kane, ˈkanes > *can, ˈcanes > cão, cães /kɐ̃w̃, kɐ̃j̃s/; ratiōnem, ratiōnēs \"reason(s)\" > PWR *raˈdʲzʲone, raˈdʲzʲones > *raˈdzon, raˈdzones > razão, razões /χaˈzɐ̃w̃, χaˈzõj̃s/ (Brazil), /ʁaˈzɐ̃ũ, ʁɐˈzõj̃ʃ/ (Portugal). Sometimes the nasalization was eliminated: lūna \"moon\" > Galician-Portuguese lũa > lua; vēna \"vein\" > Galician-Portuguese vẽa > veia. Nasal vowels that remained actually tend to be raised (rather than lowered, as in French): fīnem \"end\" > fim /fĩ/; centum \"hundred\" > PWR tʲsʲɛnto > cento /ˈsẽtu/; pontem \"bridge\" > PWR pɔnte > ponte /ˈpõtʃi/ (Brazil), /ˈpõtɨ/ (Portugal).[98]\\nRomanian shows evidence of past nasalization phenomena, the loss of palatal nasal [ɲ] in vie < Lat. vinia, and the rhotacism of intervocalic /n/ in words like mărunt < Lat. minutu for example. The effect of nasalization is observed in vowel closing to /i ɨ u/ before single /n/ and nasal+consonant clusters. Latin /nn/ and /m/ did not cause the same effect.[99]\\nCharacteristic of the Gallo-Romance and Rhaeto-Romance languages are the front rounded vowels /y ø œ/. All of these languages, with the exception of Catalan, show an unconditional change /u/ > /y/, e.g. lūnam > French lune /lyn/, Occitan /ˈlyno/. Many of the languages in Switzerland and Italy show the further change /y/ > /i/. Also very common is some variation of the French development /ɔː oː/ (lengthened in open syllables) > /we ew/ > /œ œ/, with mid back vowels diphthongizing in some circumstances and then re-monophthongizing into mid-front rounded vowels. (French has both /ø/ and /œ/, with /ø/ developing from /œ/ in certain circumstances.)\\nThere was more variability in the result of the unstressed vowels. Originally in Proto-Romance, the same nine vowels developed in unstressed as stressed syllables, and in Sardinian, they coalesced into the same five vowels in the same way.\\nIn Italo-Western Romance, however, vowels in unstressed syllables were significantly different from stressed vowels, with yet a third outcome for final unstressed syllables. In non-final unstressed syllables, the seven-vowel system of stressed syllables developed, but then the low-mid vowels /ɛ ɔ/ merged into the high-mid vowels /e o/. This system is still preserved, largely or completely, in all of the conservative Romance languages (e.g. Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan).\\nIn final unstressed syllables, results were somewhat complex. One of the more difficult issues is the development of final short -u, which appears to have been raised to /u/ rather than lowered to /o/, as happened in all other syllables. However, it is possible that in reality, final /u/ comes from long *-ū < -um, where original final -m caused vowel lengthening as well as nasalization. Evidence of this comes from Rhaeto-Romance, in particular Sursilvan, which preserves reflexes of both final -us and -um, and where the latter, but not the former, triggers metaphony. This suggests the development -us > /ʊs/ > /os/, but -um > /ũː/ > /u/.[100]\\nThe original five-vowel system in final unstressed syllables was preserved as-is in some of the more conservative central Italian languages, but in most languages there was further coalescence:\\nVarious later changes happened in individual languages, e.g.:\\nThe so-called intertonic vowels are word-internal unstressed vowels, i.e. not in the initial, final, or tonic (i.e. stressed) syllable, hence intertonic. Intertonic vowels were the most subject to loss or modification. Already in Vulgar Latin intertonic vowels between a single consonant and a following /r/ or /l/ tended to drop: vétulum \"old\" > veclum > Dalmatian vieklo, Sicilian vecchiu, Portuguese velho. But many languages ultimately dropped almost all intertonic vowels.\\nGenerally, those languages south and east of the La Spezia–Rimini Line (Romanian and Central-Southern Italian) maintained intertonic vowels, while those to the north and west (Western Romance) dropped all except /a/. Standard Italian generally maintained intertonic vowels, but typically raised unstressed /e/ > /i/. Examples:\\nPortuguese is more conservative in maintaining some intertonic vowels other than /a/: e.g. *offerḗscere \"to offer\" > Portuguese oferecer vs. Spanish ofrecer, French offrir (< *offerīre). French, on the other hand, drops even intertonic /a/ after the stress: Stéphanum \"Stephen\" > Spanish Esteban but Old French Estievne > French Étienne. Many cases of /a/ before the stress also ultimately dropped in French: sacraméntum \"sacrament\" > Old French sairement > French serment \"oath\".\\nThe Romance languages for the most part have continued to use the Latin alphabet while adapting it to their evolution.\\nOne exception was Romanian, where before the nineteenth century, the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet was used due to Slavic influence after the Roman retreat. A Cyrillic alphabet was also used for Romanian (then called Moldovan) in the USSR. The non-Christian populations of Spain also used the scripts of their religions (Arabic and Hebrew) to write Romance languages such as Judaeo-Spanish and Mozarabic in aljamiado.\\nThe classical Latin alphabet of 23 letters – A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Y, Z – was modified and augmented in various ways to yield the spelling systems of the Romance languages. In particular, the single Latin letter V split into V (consonant) and U (vowel), and the letter I split into I and J. The Latin letter K and the new letter W, which came to be widely used in Germanic languages, are seldom used in most Romance languages – mostly for unassimilated foreign names and words. Indeed, in Italian prose kilometro is properly chilometro. Portuguese and Catalan eschew importation of \"foreign\" letters more than most languages. Thus Wikipedia is Viquipèdia in Catalan but Wikipedia in Spanish; chikungunya, sandwich, kiwi are chicungunha, sanduíche, quiuí in Portuguese but chikunguña, sándwich, kiwi in Spanish.\\nWhile most of the 23 basic Latin letters have maintained their phonetic value, for some of them it has diverged considerably; and the new letters added since the Middle Ages have been put to different uses in different scripts. Some letters, notably H and Q, have been variously combined in digraphs or trigraphs (see below) to represent phonetic phenomena that could not be recorded with the basic Latin alphabet, or to get around previously established spelling conventions. Most languages added auxiliary marks (diacritics) to some letters, for these and other purposes.\\nThe spelling systems of most Romance languages are fairly simple, and consistent within any language.\\nSpelling rules are typically phonemic (as opposed to being strictly phonetic); as a result of this, the actual pronunciation of standard written forms can vary substantially according to the speaker\\'s accent (which may differ by region) or the position of a sound in the word or utterance (allophony).\\nThe following letters have notably different values between languages, or between Latin and the Romance languages:\\nOtherwise, letters that are not combined as digraphs generally represent the same phonemes as suggested by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), whose design was, in fact, greatly influenced by Romance spelling systems.\\nSince most Romance languages have more sounds than can be accommodated in the Roman Latin alphabet they all resort to the use of digraphs and trigraphs – combinations of two or three letters with a single phonemic value. The concept (but not the actual combinations) is derived from Classical Latin, which used, for example, TH, PH, and CH when transliterating the Greek letters \"θ\", \"ϕ\" (later \"φ\"), and \"χ\". These were once aspirated sounds in Greek before changing to corresponding fricatives, and the H represented what sounded to the Romans like an /ʰ/ following /t/, /p/, and /k/ respectively. Some of the digraphs used in modern scripts are:\\nWhile the digraphs CH, PH, RH and TH were at one time used in many words of Greek origin, most languages have now replaced them with C/QU, F, R and T. Only French has kept these etymological spellings, which now represent /k/ or /ʃ/, /f/, /ʀ/ and /t/, respectively.\\nGemination, in the languages where it occurs, is usually indicated by doubling the consonant, except when it does not contrast phonemically with the corresponding short consonant, in which case gemination is not indicated. In Jèrriais, long consonants are marked with an apostrophe: s\\'s is a long /zz/, ss\\'s is a long /ss/, and t\\'t is a long /tt/. The phonemic contrast between geminate and single consonants is widespread in Italian, and normally indicated in the traditional orthography: fatto /fatto/ \\'done\\' vs. fato /fato/ \\'fate, destiny\\'; cadde /kadde/ \\'s/he, it fell\\' vs. cade /kade/ \\'s/he, it falls\\'. The double consonants in French orthography, however, are merely etymological. In Catalan, the gemination of l is marked by a punt volat (\"flying point\"): l·l.\\nRomance languages also introduced various marks (diacritics) that may be attached to some letters, for various purposes. In some cases, diacritics are used as an alternative to digraphs and trigraphs; namely to represent a larger number of sounds than would be possible with the basic alphabet, or to distinguish between sounds that were previously written the same. Diacritics are also used to mark word stress, to indicate exceptional pronunciation of letters in certain words, and to distinguish words with same pronunciation (homophones).\\nDepending on the language, some letter-diacritic combinations may be considered distinct letters, e.g. for the purposes of lexical sorting. This is the case, for example, of Romanian ș ([ʃ]) and Spanish ñ ([ɲ]).\\nThe following are the most common use of diacritics in Romance languages.\\nMost languages are written with a mixture of two distinct but phonetically identical variants or \"cases\" of the alphabet: majuscule (\"uppercase\" or \"capital letters\"), derived from Roman stone-carved letter shapes, and minuscule (\"lowercase\"), derived from Carolingian writing and Medieval quill pen handwriting which were later adapted by printers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\\nIn particular, all Romance languages capitalize (use uppercase for the first letter of) the following words: the first word of each complete sentence, most words in names of people, places, and organizations, and most words in titles of books. The Romance languages do not follow the German practice of capitalizing all nouns including common ones. Unlike English, the names of months, days of the weeks, and derivatives of proper nouns are usually not capitalized: thus, in Italian one capitalizes Francia (\"France\") and Francesco (\"Francis\"), but not francese (\"French\") or francescano (\"Franciscan\"). However, each language has some exceptions to this general rule.\\nThe tables below provide a vocabulary comparison that illustrates a number of examples of sound shifts that have occurred between Latin and Romance languages. Words are given in their conventional spellings. In addition, for French the actual pronunciation is given, due to the dramatic differences between spelling and pronunciation. (French spelling approximately reflects the pronunciation of Old French, c. 1200 AD.)\\nData from Ethnologue:[120]\\n'),\n",

       " ('Pistol sword',\n",
       "  \"A pistol sword is a sword with a pistol or revolver attached, usually alongside the blade. It differs from a rifle with a bayonet attached, in that the weapon is designed primarily for use as a sword, and the firearm component is typically considered a secondary weapon designed to be an addition to the blade, rather than the sword being a secondary addition to the pistol. In addition, the two components of these weapons typically cannot be separated, unlike most bayonets mounted on rifles.\\nHistorically, some flintlock pistols of the 17th and 18th centuries were constructed as gun-swords, with the barrel of the pistol attached to the side of the blade of a shortsword or dagger. A shell guard protected the firing mechanism when it was used as a sword. These were used by French and German hunters to kill wounded wild boar.[1] Examples of these weapons can be found in the armoury of Wawel Castle (Kraków, Poland). Similar weapons were made in India,[2] including the katar (कटार), a thrusting dagger, modern variants of which may feature a single-shot pistol built into one side.\\nIn 1838, the United States Navy developed the .54 caliber, single-shot smoothbore Elgin pistol, which was equipped with an 11.5-inch Bowie knife blade[4] and was intended for use by boarding parties. It was the first percussion cap gun in naval service,[5] but only 150 were made. The Navy specifically intended them for the Wilkes-South Seas expedition. Reportedly, in 1840 a naval landing party used the pistol to good effect when Fijian warriors attacked the sailors on the island of Malolo.[6] A few Elgin pistols were still in use during the US Civil War,[7] but proved unpopular. The Navy quickly replaced them with the M1860 Cutlass, which remained in service until the 1940s. Some found their way into civilian hands and some ended up in the Old West.[citation needed]\\nPinfire cartridge gun-swords were produced in Belgium during the mid-19th century, although in limited quantity.[8][9] These custom-made weapons were sometimes used by European officers and featured a loading gate behind the basket hilt.[8] In 1866 T. Rauh of Solingen filed a United States patent on the design of a 9mm caliber pistol sword with a 32in blade.[8]\\nDuring World War I, the British manufactured a limited number of Webley revolvers with folding blades, similar in design to the Pritchard pistol bayonet.[10] These were used by officers in the trenches for close quarters fighting as the confined space made it difficult to use a sword. However, few were produced due to the expense and scarcity of raw materials.[11]\\nA rare variant of the World War II Japanese Nambu automatic pistol was a pistol sword. It is possible that this non-regulation weapon was privately purchased by an officer as only one example is known to exist.[12]\\nAnother notable example of a pistol sword was the Swedish 1865 Cutlass Pistol; 500 were ordered by the government and issued to prison guards.[13] It was a breech-loading 2-shot weapon with a 14in by 2in blade weighing 2.5\\xa0lb. A few ended up on the other side of the Atlantic and one became part of Buffalo Bill's gun collection.[14]\\nIn the late Victorian era, some French swordsticks had built-in pinfire pepperbox revolvers to increase their lethality; these were carried by civilians for self-defense. However, this idea was far from new; combination swordsticks and wheel lock pistols have been in use since the 16th century.[14]\\nPistol swords were not widely used and became uncommon relatively quickly, due to their expense and because instead of getting two weapons in one, one got a heavy pistol and a heavy, off-balance sword, as shown by the poor performance of the Elgin pistol.[15]\\nModern versions occasionally appear on the market, however, as novelties or collectors' items, including the Sierra Madre knife pistol.[16]\\n\"),\n",

       "  '\\nA machete (/məˈʃɛti/; Spanish pronunciation: [maˈtʃete]) is a broad blade used either as an  agricultural implement similar  to an axe, or in combat like a long-bladed knife. The blade is typically 30 to 45 centimetres (12 to 18\\xa0in) long and usually under 3 millimetres (1⁄8\\xa0in) thick. In the Spanish language, the word is possibly a diminutive form of the word macho, which was used to refer to sledgehammers.[1] Alternatively, its origin may be machaera, the name given by the Greeks and Romans to the falcata.[2][3] It is the origin of the English language  equivalent term matchet,[4] though this is rarely used. In much of the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica,[5] Barbados, Guyana, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago, the term cutlass is used for these agricultural tools.[6]\\nIn various tropical and subtropical countries, the machete is frequently used to cut through rainforest undergrowth and for agricultural purposes (e.g. cutting sugar cane).[7] Besides this, in Latin America a common use is for such household tasks as cutting large foodstuffs into pieces—much as a cleaver is used—or to perform crude cutting tasks, such as making simple wooden handles for other tools.[7] It is common to see people using machetes for other jobs, such as splitting open coconuts, yard work, removing small branches and plants, chopping animals\\' food, and clearing bushes.[7]\\nMachetes are often considered tools and used by adults. However, many hunter–gatherer societies and cultures surviving through subsistence agriculture begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including machetes, before their first birthdays.[8]\\nPeople in uprisings sometimes use these weapons. For example, the Boricua Popular Army are unofficially called macheteros because of the machete-wielding laborers of sugar cane fields of past Puerto Rico.[9]\\nMany of the killings in the 1994 Rwandan genocide were performed with machetes,[10] and they were the primary weapon used by the Interahamwe militias there.[11] Machetes were also a distinctive tool and weapon of the Haitian Tonton Macoute.[12]\\nIn 1762, the British captured Havana in a lengthy siege during the Seven Years\\' War. Volunteer militiamen led by Pepe Antonio, a Guanabacoa councilman, were issued with machetes during the unsuccessful defense of the city.[13] The machete was also the most iconic weapon during the independence wars in Cuba, although it saw limited battlefield use.[14] Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, owner of the sugar refinery La Demajagua near Manzanillo, freed his slaves on 10 October 1868. He proceeded to lead them, armed with machetes, in revolt against the Spanish government.[15] The first cavalry charge using machetes as the primary weapon was carried out on 4 November 1868 by Máximo Gómez, a sergeant born in the Dominican Republic, who later became the general in chief of the Cuban Army.[16]\\nThe machete is a common side arm and tool for many ethnic groups in West Africa. Machetes in this role are referenced in Chinua Achebe\\'s Things Fall Apart.[17]\\nSome countries have a name for the blow of a machete; the Spanish machetazo is sometimes used in English.[18] In the British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago, the word planass means to hit someone with the flat of the blade of a machete or cutlass.[19] To strike with the sharpened edge is to \"chop\". Throughout the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, the term \\'cutlass\\' refers to a laborers\\' cutting tool.[19]\\nThe Brazilian Army\\'s Instruction Center on Jungle Warfare developed a machete-style knife with a blade 25\\xa0cm (10\\xa0in) in length and a very pronounced clip point. This machete is issued with a 13\\xa0cm (5\\xa0in) Bowie knife and a sharpening stone in the scabbard; collectively called a \"jungle kit\" (Conjunto de Selva in Portuguese); it is manufactured by Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil (IMBEL).[20]\\nThe machete was used as a weapon during the Mau Mau rebellion, in the Rwandan Genocide, and in South Africa, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s when the former province of Natal was wracked by conflict between the African National Congress and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.[21]\\nGood machetes rely on the materials used and the shape. In the past, the most famous manufacturer of machetes in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean was Collins Company of Collinsville, Connecticut.[22] The company was founded as Collins & Company in 1826 by Samuel W. Collins to make axes.[23] Its first machetes were sold in 1845[24] and became so famous that a machete was called un collin.[25] In the English-speaking Caribbean, Robert Mole & Sons of Birmingham, England, was long considered the manufacturer of agricultural cutlasses of the best quality. Some Robert Mole blades survive as souvenirs of travellers to Trinidad,[26] Jamaica, and, less commonly, St. Lucia.[citation needed]\\nColombia is the largest exporter of machetes worldwide.[27]\\nThe flag of Angola features a machete, along with a cog-wheel.\\nThe southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has a dance called the dança dos facões (machetes\\' dance) in which the dancers, who are usually men, bang their machetes against various surfaces while dancing, simulating a battle. Maculelê, an Afro-Brazilian dance and martial art, can also be performed with facões.

       " ('Pop music',\n",
       "  'Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.[4] During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.\\nIdentifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse–chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.\\nThe terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former more accurately describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music.\\nDavid Hatch and Stephen Millward describe pop music as \"a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music\".[9]\\nAccording to Pete Seeger, pop music is \"professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music\".[3]\\nDavid Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music as any type of music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media.[10] Most individuals think that pop music is just the singles charts and not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. As a genre, pop music is seen to exist and develop separately.[11] Therefore, the term \"pop music\" may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as \"instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers\" in contrast to rock music as \"album-based music for adults\".[4][13]\\nPop music continuously evolves along with the term\\'s definition. According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as \"the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.\"[14] The term \"pop song\" was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music \"having popular appeal\".[15] Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues, and hillbilly music.[16]\\nAccording to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the term \"pop music\" \"originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced\".[2] The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop\\'s \"earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc.\"[17] Grove Music Online also states that \"[...] in the early 1960s, [the term] \\'pop music\\' competed terminologically with beat music [in England], while in the US its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of \\'rock and roll\\'\".[2]\\n\\nFrom about 1967, the term \"pop music\" was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms.[18] While rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music,[18] pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.[19] According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced \"as a matter of enterprise not art\", and is \"designed to appeal to everyone\" but \"doesn\\'t come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste\". Frith adds that it is \"not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative\". It is, \"provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below\\xa0... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged\".[4] According to Frith, characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology, and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal \"artistic\" qualities.[4] Besides, Frith also offers three identifying characteristics of pop music: light entertainment, commercial imperatives, and personal identification. Pop music grew out of a light entertainment and easy listening tradition.[22] Pop music is more conservative than other music genres such as folk, blues, country, and tradition. Many pop songs do not contain themes of resistance, opposition, or political themes, rather focusing more on love and relationships.  Therefore, pop music does not challenge its audiences socially, and does not cause political activism. Frith also said the main purpose of pop music is to create revenue. It is not a medium of free articulation of the people. Instead, pop music seeks to supply the nature of personal desire and achieve the instant empathy with cliche personalities, stereotypes, and melodrama that appeals to listeners. It is mostly about how much revenue pop music makes for record companies.[23] Music scholar Timothy Warner said pop music typically has an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, rather than live performance; a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments; and seeks to encourage dancing or uses dance-oriented rhythms.[19]\\nThe main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and a simple traditional structure.[26] The structure of many popular songs is that of a verse and a chorus, the chorus serving as the portion of the track that is designed to stick in the ear through simple repetition both musically and lyrically. The chorus is often where the music builds towards and is often preceded by \"the drop\" where the bass and drum parts \"drop out\".[27] Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks, and a chorus that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and harmonically with the verse.[28] The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment.[29] The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes\\xa0– often love and romantic relationships\\xa0– although there are notable exceptions.[4]\\nHarmony and chord progressions in pop music are often \"that of classical European tonality, only more simple-minded.\"[30] Clichés include the barbershop quartet-style harmony (i.e. ii – V – I) and blues scale-influenced harmony.[31] There was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the circle of fifths between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, including less predominance for the dominant function.[32]\\nIn October 2023, Billboard compiled a list of \"the 500 best pop songs\". In doing so, it noted the difficulty of defining \"pop songs\":\\nOne of the reasons pop can be hard to summarize is because there’s no real sonic or musical definition to it. There are common elements to a lot of the biggest pop songs, but at the end of the day, \"pop\" means \"popular\" first and foremost, and just about any song that becomes popular enough...can be considered a pop song.[33]In the 1940s, improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style and, ten or twenty years later, inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles \"revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated\", which helped to move pop music to \"a record/radio/film star system\".[35] Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances, which meant that \"pop stars had to have a visual presence\".[35] In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable transistor radios meant that teenagers in the developed world could listen to music outside of the home.[35] By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which \"favoured those artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal\".[35]\\nMulti-track recording (from the 1960s) and digital sampling (from the 1980s) have also been used as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music.[4] During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word \"progressive\" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a \"progression\" from the last.[36] Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between \"progressive\" pop and \"mass/chart\" pop, a separation which was \"also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\"[37]\\nThe latter half of the 20th century included a large-scale trend in American culture in which the boundaries between art and pop music were increasingly blurred.[38] Between 1950 and 1970, there was a debate of pop versus art.[39] Since then, certain music publications have embraced the music\\'s legitimacy, a trend referred to as \"poptimism\".[39]\\nThroughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on traditional pop, an American counterpart to German Schlager and French Chanson, however compared to the pop of European countries, traditional pop originally emphasized influences ranging from Tin Pan Alley songwriting, Broadway theatre, and show tunes. As the genre evolved more influences ranging from classical, folk, rock, country, electronic music, and other popular genres became more prominent. In 2016, a Scientific Reports study that examined over 464,000 recordings of popular music recorded between 1955 and 2010 found that, compared to 1960s pop music, contemporary pop music uses a smaller variety of pitch progressions, greater average volume,[40] less diverse instrumentation and recording techniques, and less timbral variety.[41] Scientific American\\'s John Matson reported that this \"seems to support the popular anecdotal observation that pop music of yore was \"better\", or at least more varied, than today\\'s top-40 stuff\". However, he also noted that the study may not have been entirely representative of pop in each generation.[41]\\nIn the 1960s,  the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra.[42] Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector\\'s Wall of Sound and Joe Meek\\'s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados.[43] At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined Tin Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched electric guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians.[44]  A 2019 study held by New York University in which 643 participants had to rank how familiar a pop song is to them, songs from the 1960s turned out to be the most memorable, significantly more than songs from recent years 2000 to 2015.[45]\\nBefore the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.[46] Assisted by the mid-1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them the freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing.[47] This situation declined after the late 1970s and would not reemerge until the rise of Internet stars.[47] Indie pop, which developed in the late 1970s, marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, with guitar bands formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label.[48]\\nThe 1980s are commonly remembered for an increase in the use of digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synth-pop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity.[49] By 2014, pop music worldwide had been permeated by electronic dance music.[50] In 2018, researchers at the University of California, Irvine, concluded that pop music has become \\'sadder\\' since the 1980s. The elements of happiness and brightness have eventually been replaced with electronic beats making pop music more \\'sad yet danceable\\'.[51]\\nPop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British music industries, whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture, but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics.[53] Some of these trends (for example Europop) have had a significant impact on the development of the genre.[54]\\nThe story of pop music is largely the story of the intertwining pop culture of the United States and the United Kingdom in the postwar era.\\n\\xa0— Bob Stanley[50]\\nAccording to Grove Music Online, \"Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures\".[57] Some non-Western countries, such as Japan, have developed a thriving pop music industry, most of which is devoted to Western-style pop. Japan has for several years produced a greater quantity of music than everywhere except the US.[clarification needed][57] The spread of Western-style pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of Americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative appropriation, cultural imperialism, or a more general process of globalization.[57]\\nOne of the pop music styles that developed alongside other music styles is Latin pop, which rose in popularity in the US during the 1950s with early rock and roll success Ritchie Valens.[58] Later, Los Lobos and Chicano rock gained in popularity during the 1970s and 1980s, and musician Selena saw large-scale popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, along with crossover appeal with fans of Tejano musicians Lydia Mendoza and Little Joe.[citation needed] With later Hispanic and Latino Americans seeing success within pop music charts, 1990s pop successes stayed popular in both their original genres and in broader pop music.[59] Latin pop hit singles, such as \"Macarena\" by Los del Río and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi, have seen record-breaking success on worldwide pop music charts.[60]\\nNotable pop artists of the late 20th century that became global superstars include Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Madonna, George Michael, and Prince.\\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, the trends that dominated during the late 1990s still continued, but the music industry started to change as people began to download music from the internet. People were able to discover genres and artists that were outside of the mainstream and propel them to fame, but at the same time smaller artists had a harder time making a living because their music was being pirated.[62] Popular artists were Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake (as well as NSYNC), Christina Aguilera, Destiny\\'s Child, and Britney Spears. Pop music often came from many different genres, with each genre in turn influencing the next one, blurring the lines between them and making them less distinct. This change was epitomized in Spears\\' highly influential 2007 album Blackout, which under the influence of producer Danja, mixed the sounds of EDM, avant-funk, R&B, dance music, and hip hop.[63]\\nBy the year 2010, pop music impacted by dance music came to be dominant on the charts. Instead of the radio setting the trends, it was now the club. \"The new bubble is all the collective clubs around the world. Radio is just doing its best to keep up\", said Will.i.am. at the beginning of the decade.[64] Songs that talked of escapism through partying became the most popular, influenced by the impulse to forget the economic troubles that had taken over the world after the 2008 crash.[65] The most popular artists of this era were Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, the Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry and One Direction.\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\nDoha (Arabic: الدوحة, romanized:\\xa0ad-Dawḥa [adˈduħa] or ad-Dūḥa) is the capital city and main financial hub of Qatar. Located on the Persian Gulf coast in the east of the country, north of Al Wakrah and south of Al Khor, it is home to most of the country\\'s population.[2] It is also Qatar\\'s fastest growing city, with over 80% of the nation\\'s population living in Doha or its surrounding suburbs.[1]\\nDoha was founded in the 1820s as an offshoot of Al Bidda. It was officially declared as the country\\'s capital in 1971, when Qatar gained independence from being a British protectorate.[3] As the commercial capital of Qatar and one of the emergent financial centers in the Middle East, Doha is considered a beta-level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Doha accommodates Education City, an area devoted to research and education, and Hamad Medical City, an administrative area of medical care. It also includes Doha Sports City, or Aspire Zone, an international sports destination that includes Khalifa International Stadium, Hamad Aquatic Centre; and the Aspire Dome.\\nThe city was host to the first ministerial-level meeting of the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization negotiations. It was also selected as host city of a number of sporting events, including the 2006 Asian Games, the 2011 Pan Arab Games, the 2019 World Beach Games, the FINA World Aquatics Championships, the FIVB Volleyball Club World Championship, the WTA Finals and most of the games at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. In December 2011, the World Petroleum Council held the 20th World Petroleum Conference in Doha.[4] Additionally, the city hosted the 2012 UNFCCC Climate Negotiations and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[5] The city will host the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\\nThe city also hosted the 140th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in April 2019 and hosted 18th yearly session United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2012. Doha has been named as the second safest city in the world in Numbeo Crime Index by City 2021.[6] The index, which tracks safety in 431 cities, reaffirms the country\\'s outstanding level of safety and security, while strengthening Doha\\'s reputation as a desirable city where business and leisure travellers can enjoy award-winning hospitality, business-friendly environments and service excellence.[7]\\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment of Doha, the name \"Doha\" originated from the Arabic term dohat, meaning \"roundness\"—a reference to the rounded bays surrounding the area\\'s coastline.[8]\\nThe city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as Al Bidda. The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681 by the Carmelite Convent, in an account which chronicles several settlements in Qatar. In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to.[9][10] Carsten Niebuhr, a German explorer who visited the Arabian Peninsula, created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765 in which he labelled it as \\'Guttur\\'.[9][11]\\nDavid Seaton, a British political resident in Muscat, wrote the first English record of Al Bidda in 1801. He refers to the town as \\'Bedih\\' and describes the geography and defensive structures in the area.[12] He stated that the town had recently been settled by the Sudan tribe (singular Al-Suwaidi), whom he considered to be pirates. Seaton attempted to bombard the town with his warship, but returned to Muscat upon finding that the waters were too shallow to position his warship within striking distance.[13][14]\\nIn 1820, British surveyor R. H. Colebrook, who visited Al Bidda, remarked on the recent depopulation of the town. He wrote:[13][15]\\nGuttur – Or Ul Budee [Al‐Bidda], once a considerable town, is protected by two square Ghurries [forts] near the seashore; but containing no freshwater they are incapable of defense except against sudden incursions of Bedouins, another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This could contain two hundred men. There are remaining at Ul Budee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men.The same year, an agreement known as the General Maritime Treaty was signed between the East India Company and the sheikhs of several Persian Gulf settlements (some of which were later known as the Trucial Coast). It acknowledged British authority in the Persian Gulf and sought to end piracy and the slave trade. Bahrain became a party to the treaty, and it was assumed that Qatar, perceived as a dependency of Bahrain by the British, was also a party to it.[16] Qatar, however, was not asked to fly the prescribed Trucial flag.[17] As punishment for alleged piracy committed by the inhabitants of Al Bidda and breach of the treaty, an East India Company vessel bombarded the town in 1821. They razed the town, forcing between 300 and 400 natives to flee and temporarily take shelter on the islands between Qatar and the Trucial Coast.[18]\\nDoha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s.[19] In January 1823, political[clarification needed] resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the chief of the Al-Buainain tribe.[19][20] MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time. Following the founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements.[19] Later that year, Lt. Guy and Lt. Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements. Despite being mapped as two separate entities, they were referred to under the collective name of Al Bidda in the written description.[21][22]\\nIn 1828, Mohammed bin Khamis, a prominent member of the Al-Buainain tribe and successor of Buhur bin Jubrun as chief of Al Bidda, was embroiled in controversy. He had murdered a native of Bahrain, prompting the Al Khalifa sheikh to imprison him. In response, the Al-Buainain tribe revolted, provoking the Al Khalifa to destroy the tribe\\'s fort and evict them to Fuwayrit and Ar Ru\\'ays. This incident allowed the Al Khalifa additional jurisdiction over the town.[23][24] With essentially no effective ruler, Al Bidda and Doha became a sanctuary for pirates and outlaws.[25]\\nIn November 1839, an outlaw from Abu Dhabi named Ghuleta took refuge in Al Bidda, evoking a harsh response from the British. A. H. Nott, a British naval commander, demanded that Salemin bin Nasir Al-Suwaidi, chief of the Sudan tribe (Suwaidi) in Al Bidda, take Ghuleta into custody and warned him of consequences in the case of non-compliance. Al-Suwaidi obliged the British request in February 1840 and also arrested the pirate Jasim bin Jabir and his associates. Despite the compliance, the British demanded a fine of 300 German krones in compensation for the damages incurred by pirates off the coast of Al Bidda; namely for the piracies committed by bin Jabir. In February 1841, British naval squadrons arrived in Al Bidda and ordered Al-Suwaidi to meet the British demand, threatening consequences if he declined. Al-Suwaidi ultimately declined on the basis that he was uninvolved in bin Jabir\\'s actions. On 26 February, the British fired on Al Bidda, striking a fort and several houses. Al-Suwaidi then paid the fine in full following threats of further action by the British.[25][26]\\nIsa bin Tarif, a powerful tribal chief from the Al Bin Ali tribe, moved to Doha in May 1843. He subsequently evicted the ruling Sudan tribe and installed the Al-Maadeed and Al-Kuwari tribes in positions of power.[27] Bin Tarif had been loyal to the Al Khalifa, however, shortly after the swearing-in of a new ruler in Bahrain, bin Tarif grew increasingly suspicious of the ruling Al Khalifa and switched his allegiance to the deposed ruler of Bahrain, Abdullah bin Khalifa, whom he had previously assisted in deposing of. Bin Tarif died in the Battle of Fuwayrit against the ruling family of Bahrain in 1847.[27]\\nThe Al Thani family migrated to Doha from Fuwayrit shortly after Bin Tarif\\'s death in 1847 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani.[28][29] In the proceeding years, the Al Thani family assumed control of the town. At various times, they swapped allegiances between the two prevailing powers in the area: the Al Khalifa of Bahrain and the Bin Saudis.[28]\\nIn 1867, many ships and troops were sent from Bahrain to assault the towns Al Wakrah and Doha over a series of disputes. Abu Dhabi joined on Bahrain\\'s behalf due to the perception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for fugitives from Oman. Later that year, the combined forces sacked the two Qatari towns with around 2,700 men in what would come to be known as the Qatari–Bahraini War.[30][31] A British record later stated that \"the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\".[32]\\nThe joint Bahraini-Abu Dhabi incursion and subsequent Qatari counterattack prompted the British political agent, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to impose a settlement in 1868. Pelly\\'s mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the peace treaty that resulted were milestones in Qatar\\'s history. It implicitly recognized Qatar as a distinct entity independent from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani as an important representative of the peninsula\\'s tribes.[33]\\nIn December 1871, the Ottomans established a presence in the country with 100 of their troops occupying the Musallam fort in Doha. This was accepted by Mohammad bin Thani\\'s son, Jassim Al Thani, who wished to protect Doha from Saudi incursions.[34] The Ottoman commander, Major Ömer Bey, compiled a report on Al Bidda in January 1872, stating that it was an \"administrative centre\" with around 1,000 houses and 4,000 inhabitants.[35]\\nDisagreement over tribute and interference in internal affairs arose, eventually leading to the Battle of Al Wajbah in March 1893. Al Bidda fort served as the final point of retreat for Ottoman troops. While they were garrisoned in the fort, their corvette fired indiscriminately at the townspeople, killing a number of civilians.[36] The Ottomans eventually surrendered after Jassim Al Thani\\'s troops cut off the town\\'s water supply.[37] An Ottoman report compiled the same year reported that Al Bidda and Doha had a combined population of 6,000 inhabitants, jointly referring to both towns by the name of \\'Katar\\'. Doha was classified as the eastern section of Katar.[35][38] The Ottomans held a passive role in Qatar\\'s politics from the 1890s onward until fully relinquishing control during the beginning of the first World War.[16]\\nPearling had come to play a pivotal commercial role in Doha by the 20th century. The population increased to around 12,000 inhabitants in the first half of the 20th century due to the flourishing pearl trade.[39] A British political resident noted that should the supply of pearls drop, Qatar would \\'practically cease to exist\\'.[40] In 1907, the city accommodated 350 pearling boats with a combined crew size of 6,300 men. By this time, the average prices of pearls had more than doubled since 1877.[41] The pearl market collapsed that year, forcing Jassim Al Thani to sell the country\\'s pearl harvest at half its value. The aftermath of the collapse resulted in the establishment of the country\\'s first custom house in Doha.[40]\\nBritish administrator and historian J. G. Lorimer authored an extensive handbook for British agents in the Persian Gulf entitled Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf in 1908. In it, he gives a comprehensive account of Doha at the time:\\nGenerally so styled at the present day, but Bedouins sometimes call it Dohat-al-Qatar, and it seems to have been formerly better known as Bida\\' (Anglice \"Bidder\"): it is the chief town of Qatar and is situated on the eastern side of that peninsula, about 63 miles south of its extremity at Ras Rakan and 45 miles north of Khor-al Odaid Harbour. Dohah stands on the south side of a deep bay at the south-western corner of a natural harbor which is about 3 miles in extent and is protected on the north-east and south-east sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east between the points of the reefs; it is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular: the bottom is white mud or clay.\\nTownsite and quarters, — The south-eastern point of the bay are quite low but the land on the western side is stony desert 40 or 50 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built up the slope of some rising ground between these two extremes and consists of 9 Fanqs or quarters, which are given below in their order from the east to the west and north: the total frontage of the place upon the sea is nearly 2 miles.[42]\\nLorimer goes on to list and describe the districts of Doha, which at the time included the still-existing districts of Al Mirqab, As Salatah, Al Bidda and Rumeilah.[43] Remarking on Doha\\'s appearance, he states:\\nThe general appearance of Dohah is unattractive; the lanes are narrow and irregular the houses dingy and small. There are no date palms or other trees, and the only garden is a small one near the fort, kept up by the Turkish garrison.[44]\\nAs for Doha\\'s population, Lorimer asserts that \"the inhabitants of Dohah are estimated to amount, inclusive of the Turkish military garrison of 350 men, to about 12,000 souls\". He qualified this statement with a tabulated overview of the various tribes and ethnic groups living in the town.[44]\\nIn April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all their troops from Qatar. Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the start of World War I.[45] One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British protectorate with Doha as its official capital.[46][47]\\nBuildings at the time were simple dwellings of one or two rooms, built from mud, stone and coral. Oil concessions in the 1920s and 1930s, and subsequent oil drilling in 1939, heralded the beginning of slow economic and social progress in the country. However, revenues were somewhat diminished due to the devaluation of pearl trade in the Persian Gulf brought on by the introduction of the cultured pearl and the Great Depression.[48] The collapse of the pearl trade caused a significant population drop throughout the entire country.[39] It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the country saw significant monetary returns from oil drilling.[16]\\nQatar was not long in exploiting the new-found wealth from oil concessions, and slum areas were quickly razed to be replaced by more modern buildings. The first formal boys\\' school was established in Doha in 1952, followed three years later by the establishment of a girls\\' school.[49] Historically, Doha had been a commercial port of local significance. However, the shallow water of the bay prevented bigger ships from entering the port until the 1970s, when its deep-water port was completed. Further changes followed with extensive land reclamation, which led to the development of the crescent-shaped bay.[50] From the 1950s to 1970s, the population of Doha grew from around 14,000 inhabitants to over 83,000, with foreign immigrants constituting about two-thirds of the overall population.[51]\\nQatar officially declared its independence in 1971, with Doha as its capital city.[3] In 1973, the University of Qatar was opened by emiri decree,[52] and in 1975 the Qatar National Museum opened in what was originally the ruler\\'s palace.[53] During the 1970s, all old neighborhoods in Doha were razed and the inhabitants moved to new suburban developments, such as Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa and Al Gharafa. The metropolitan area\\'s population grew from 89,000 in the 1970s to over 434,000 in 1997. Additionally, land policies resulted in the total land area increasing to over 7,100 hectares (about 17,000 acres) by 1995, an increase from 130 hectares in the middle of the 20th century.[54]\\nIn 1983, a hotel and conference center was developed at the north end of the Corniche. The 15-storey Sheraton hotel structure in this center would serve as the tallest structure in Doha until the 1990s.[54] In 1993, the Qatar Open became the first major sports event to be hosted in the city.[55] Two years later, Qatar stepped in to host the FIFA World Youth Championship, with all the matches being played in Doha-based stadiums.[56]\\nThe Al Jazeera Arabic news channel began broadcasting from Doha in 1996.[57] In the late 1990s, the government planned the construction of Education City, a 2,500 hectare Doha-based complex mainly for educational institutes.[58] Since the start of the 21st century, Doha attained significant media attention due to the hosting of several global events and the inauguration of a number of architectural mega-projects.[59] One of the largest projects launched by the government was The Pearl-Qatar, an artificial island off the coast of West Bay, which launched its first district in 2004.[60] In 2006, Doha was selected to host the Asian Games, leading to the development of a 250-hectare sporting complex known as Aspire Zone.[55] During this time, new cultural attractions were constructed in the city, with older ones being restored. In 2006, the government launched a restoration program to preserve Souq Waqif\\'s architectural and historical identity. Parts constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008.[61] Katara Cultural Village was opened in the city in 2010 and has hosted the Doha Tribeca Film Festival since then.[62]\\nThe main outcome of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2013 was the Trade Facilitation Agreement.  The agreement aims to make it easier and cheaper to import and export by improving customs procedures and making rules more transparent.  Reducing global trade costs by 1% would increase worldwide income by more than US$40 billion, 65% of which would go to developing countries.  The gains from the Trade Facilitation Agreement are expected to be distributed among all countries and regions, with developing landlocked countries benefiting the most.[63]\\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement will enter into force upon its ratification by 2/3 of WTO Members. The EU ratified the agreement in October 2015.[63]\\nIn Bali, WTO members also agreed on a series of Doha agriculture and development issues.[63]\\nNow modernizing city while preserving traditions is part of the country\\'s long-term plan, Qatar National Vision 2030.\\nDoha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast. Its elevation is 10\\xa0m (33\\xa0ft).[64] Doha is highly urbanized. Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30\\xa0km of coastline.[65] Half of the 22\\xa0km2 of surface area which Hamad International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land.[66] The geology of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the Eocene period Dammam Formation, forming dolomitic limestone.[67]\\nThe Pearl is an artificial island in Doha with a surface area of nearly 400\\xa0ha (1,000 acres)[68] The total project has been estimated to cost $15 billion upon completion.[69] Other islands off Doha\\'s coast include Palm Tree Island, Shrao\\'s Island, Al Safliya Island, and Alia Island.[70]\\nIn a 2010 survey of Doha\\'s coastal waters conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority, it was found that its maximum depth was 7.5 meters (25\\xa0ft) and minimum depth was 2 meters (6\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in). Furthermore, the waters had an average pH of 7.83, a salinity of 49.0 psu, an average temperature of 22.7\\xa0°C and 5.5\\xa0mg/L of dissolved oxygen.[71]\\nDoha has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters. The average high temperatures between May and September surpass 38\\xa0°C (100\\xa0°F) and often approach 45\\xa0°C (113\\xa0°F). Humidity is usually the lowest in May and June. Dewpoints can surpass 30\\xa0°C (86\\xa0°F) in the summer.  Throughout the summer, the city averages almost no precipitation, and less than 20\\xa0mm (0.79\\xa0in) during other months.[72] Rainfall is scarce, at a total of 75\\xa0mm (2.95\\xa0in) per year, falling on isolated days mostly between October and March. The winter\\'s days are relativity warm while the sun is up and cool during the night. The temperature rarely drops below 7\\xa0°C (45\\xa0°F).[73] The highest temperature recorded was 50.4\\xa0°C (122.7\\xa0°F) on 14 July 2010, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Qatar.[74]\\nA significant portion of Qatar\\'s population lives within Doha and its metropolitan area.[87] The district with the highest population density is the central area of Al Najada, which also accommodates the highest total population in the country. The population density across the greater Doha region ranges from 20,000 people per km2 to 25-50 people per km2.[88] Doha witnessed explosive growth rates in population in the first decade of the 21st century, absorbing the majority of the thousands of people then immigrating to Qatar every month.[89]:\\u200a6\\u200a Doha\\'s population is around one million, with the population of the city more than doubling from 2000 to 2010.[1]\\nThe population of Doha is overwhelmingly composed of expatriates, with Qatari nationals forming a minority. The largest portion of expatriates in Qatar are from South-East and South Asian countries, mainly India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Philippines, and Bangladesh with large numbers of expatriates also coming from the Levant Arab countries, Djibouti, Somalia, North Africa, and East Asia. Doha is also home to many expatriates from Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia.[90]\\nArabic is the official language of Qatar. English is commonly used as a second language,[91] and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce.[92] As there is a large expatriate population in Doha, languages such as Malayalam, Tamil, Bengali, Tagalog, Spanish, Sinhala, French, Urdu and Hindi are widely spoken.[90]\\nIn 2004, the Foreign Ownership of Real Estate Law was passed, permitting non-Qatari citizens to buy land in designated areas of Doha, including the West Bay Lagoon, the Qatar Pearl, and the new Lusail City.[59] Prior to this, expatriates were prohibited from owning land in Qatar. Ownership by foreigners in Qatar entitles them to a renewable residency permit, which allows them to live and work in Qatar.[87]\\nThe majority of residents in Doha are Muslim.[97] Catholics account for over 90% of the 150,000 Christian population in Doha.[98] Following decrees by the Emir for the allocation of land to churches, the first Catholic church, Our Lady of the Rosary, was opened in Doha in March 2008. The church structure is discreet and Christian symbols are not displayed on the outside of the building.[99] Several other churches exist in Doha, including the St.Isaac and St. George Greek Orthodox Church of Qatar, Doha, Qatar St.Isaac and St. George Greek Orthodox Church of Qatar the Syro-Malabar Church, Malankara Orthodox Church, Mar Thoma Church (affiliated with the Anglicans, but not part of the Communion), CSI Church, Syro-Malankara Church and a Pentecostal church. A majority of mosques are either Salafi or Sunni-oriented.[100]\\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Doha was divided into 9 main districts.[101] In the 2010 census, there were more than 60 districts recorded in Doha Municipality.[102] Some of the districts of Doha include:\\nShortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha including Al Najada, Al Asmakh and Old Al Hitmi faced gradual decline and as a result, much of their historical architecture has been demolished.[103] Instead, the government shifted their focus toward the Doha Bay area, which housed districts such as Al Dafna and West Bay.[103]\\nDoha is the economic center of Qatar. The city is the headquarters of numerous domestic and international organizations, including the country\\'s largest oil and gas companies, QatarEnergy and QatarEnergy LNG. Doha\\'s economy is built primarily on the revenue the country has made from its oil and natural gas industries.[104] Doha was included in Fortune\\'s 15 best new cities for business in 2011.[105]Beginning in the late 20th century, the government launched numerous initiatives to diversify the country\\'s economy in order to decrease its dependence on oil and gas resources. Doha International Airport was constructed in a bid to solidify the city\\'s diversification into the tourism industry.[104] This was replaced by Hamad International Airport in 2014. The new airport is almost twice the size of the former and features two of the longest runways in the world.[106] Thirty-nine new hotels were under construction in the city in 2011.[107]\\nAs a result of Doha\\'s rapid population boom and increased housing demands, real estate prices rose significantly through 2014.[108] Real estate prices experienced a further spike after Qatar won the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[109] Al Asmakh, a Qatari real estate firm, released a report in 2014 which revealed substantial increases in real estate prices following a peak in 2008. Prices increased 5 to 10% in the first quarter of 2014 from the end of 2013.[108][110] A 2015 study conducted by Numbeo, a crowd-sourced database, named Doha as the 10th most expensive city to live in globally.[111] This rate of growth led to the development of planned communities in and around the city.[112] Although the fall in oil prices since 2014 and a diplomatic crisis with Qatar\\'s neighbors slowed growth in the city\\'s population, government spending was increased to maintain the growth in real estate in metropolitan Doha.[113]\\nExpatriate workers remitted $60bn between 2006 and 2012, with 54 percent of the workers\\' remittances of $60bn routed to Asian countries, followed by Arab nations that accounted for nearly half that volume (28 percent). India was the top destination of the remittances, followed by the Philippines, while the US, Egypt and the neighbouring UAE followed.[114] Remittances in 2014 totaled $11.2 billion, amounting to 5.3% of Qatar\\'s GDP.[115]:\\u200a45\\u200a\\nDoha is considered as the most important tourist city in Qatar. Qatar tourism sector is also a key focus of its economic diversification strategy. The country is investing in the development of new tourism infrastructure, such as hotels and resorts, and promoting its cultural attractions, such as the Museum of Islamic Art and the Katara Cultural Village to attract visitors from around the world. In addition, Qatar Airways has become one of the world\\'s leading airlines, connecting the country to major cities across the globe. Qatar has also been attracting major international events to the country, such as the FIFA World Cup 2022, which is expected to generate significant revenue for the country and boost its tourism sector. High and rising incomes in Qatar offer significant opportunities in food and drink and grocery retail sectors. Premium and healthy brands are especially well received. Convenience food is also an increasingly important sector for younger Qataris and visitors.[116]In recent years, Qatar has been taking steps to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil and gas revenues. The country has launched a number of initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors such as tourism, finance, and technology. For example, Qatar has invested heavily in building world-class infrastructure, including the Hamad International Airport and the Qatar Free Zones Authority, to attract foreign investors and businesses to set up shop in the country. Moreover, Qatar has also been working towards creating a more business-friendly environment by streamlining regulations and offering incentives to start-ups and small businesses. The country ambition in this area can already be seen in developments like the recently completed M7 building in downtown Doha. This futuristic five story construction is described as an epicentre for innovation and entrepreneurship in design, fashion and technology.[117]The latest research by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) which highlighted the top 10 cities where international travelers spent the most in 2022, showed Doha, Qatar at the number 2 spot with $16.8 bn.[118]Qatar has received over 2.56 million visitors from January until 25 August 2023, exceeding the full year arrival figures from 2022, representing a 157 per cent increase over the same period last year, according to a report by Zawya citing figures released yesterday by Qatar Tourism (QT).[119][120]Doha named Arab tourism capital for 2023. Non-GCC tourists made up 66% of all visitors in October, an increase of 10% from the previous month 2023.[121] Doha in 2023 hosted International Horticultural Expo 2023, Spanning 1.7 million square meters, the event takes place in Al Bidda Park, one of the biggest parks in Doha which overlooks the Persian Gulf. [122][123][124]\\nMany of the older structures (1960–1970s) in the Old Doha districts have been demolished to make space for new buildings.[103] A number of schemes have been taken to preserve the city\\'s cultural and architectural heritage, such as the Qatar Museums Authority\\'s \\'Al Turath al Hai\\' (\\'living heritage\\') initiative.[125] Katara Cultural Village is a model village in Doha launched by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser under Qatar Foundation to preserve the cultural identity of the country.[126]\\nIn 2011, more than 50 towers were under construction in Doha,[107] the largest of which was the Doha Convention Center Tower.[127] Constructions were suspended in 2012 following concerns that the tower would impede flight traffic[128] and the site is being redeveloped into a park.\\nIn 2014, Abdullah Al Attiyah, a senior government official, announced that Qatar would be spending $65bn on new infrastructure projects in upcoming years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup as well as progressing towards its objectives set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030.[129]\\nMsheireb Downtown Doha, a 31 hectares development costing an estimated $5bn, was dubbed the largest inner city redevelopment of its kind when launched. Comprises several quarters opened over different phases, Msheireb aims to preserve and enhance the historic downtown area.\\nThe new National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) opened to the public on March 28, 2019.[130] The museum features an innovative design by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel[131] that is inspired by the desert rose and grows organically around the original 20th century palace of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani. This important monument to Qatar\\'s past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ.[132] The relation between the new and old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by Sheikha Al Mayassa for it is the way to \"define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others celebrating our identity.\"[133]Located on a 1.5\\xa0million-square-foot site at the south end of Doha Corniche, the NMoQ building rises from the sea and is connected to the shore by two pedestrian bridges and a road bridge.\\nDoha Tower also known as Burj Doha, and previously named as Burj Qatar and Doha High Rise Office Building,[134] is a high rise tower in West Bay, Doha.

The Msheireb Museums are part of the first phase of the Heritage Quarter of Msheireb Properties’ QR20 billion (US$5.5 billion), 310,000 sq m development.[142] The museum was also included in the 2018 world\\'s best new buildings list of the Royal Institute of British Architects.[143]\\nDue to excessive heat from the sun during the summer, some Doha-based building companies have implemented various forms of cooling technology to alleviate the extremely torrid climatic conditions. This can include creating optical phenomena such as shadows, as well as more expensive techniques like ventilation, coolants, refrigerants, cryogenics, and dehumidifiers.[144] Discussions regarding temperature control have also been features of various scheduled events involving large crowds.[145] There are other initiatives that attempt to counter the heat by altering working hours, weather alteration methods such as cloud seeding,[146][147] and using whiter and brighter construction materials to increase the albedo effects.[148] Nonetheless, despite these measures, Doha and other areas of Qatar could become uninhabitable for humans due to climate change by the end of the 21st century.[149][150]\\nOne of the largest projects underway in Qatar is Lusail City, a planned community north of Doha which is estimated to be completed by 2020 at a cost of approximately $45bn.

       "  'A balisong, also known as a butterfly knife, fan knife or Batangas knife, is a type of folding pocketknife that originated in the Philippines. Its distinct features are two handles counter-rotating around the tang such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. A latch sometimes holds the handles together, typically mounted on the one facing the cutting edge (the \"bite handle\").[1]\\nThe balisong was commonly used by Filipinos, especially those in the Tagalog region, as a self-defense and pocket utility knife. Hollow-grind balisongs were also used as straight razors before conventional razors were available in the Philippines. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called \"flipping\", are performed for art or amusement. Blunt \"trainer\" versions of these knives are available and can be used to practice tricks without the risk of injury.\\nThe knife is now illegal or restricted in some countries, often under the same laws and for the same reasons that switchblades or concealed weapons are restricted. Within the Philippines, it is no longer as common in urban areas as in the past.[2]\\nNames for the knives in English include \"fan knives\" and \"butterfly knives\" from the motion, and \"click clacks\" from the sound they make when they are opened and closed.\\nThe name \"balisong\" is derived from barangay (village) Balisong, part of the municipality of Taal, Batangas province, which along with the neighboring barangay Pandayan, were the original manufacturing centers of the knives in the Philippines. The two barangays were home to a blacksmith industry that also produced other bladed implements such as bolo knives.[3][4][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed][5] It is also claimed that the meaning of the term balisong is derived from the Tagalog words baling sungay (literally, \"broken/folding horn\") as the hilt of the blade were traditionally made from carved carabao and deer horn, as well as bones.[6][7] The traditional balisong is also known as veinte y nueve, or \"twenty-nine,\" in the Philippines, because they are 29\\xa0cm (11\\xa0in) long when opened.\\nThe origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 CE. However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong mass production in the Philippines can only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong were originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called the pied du roi (\"foot of the king\"), invented between the 1500s to the late 1760s. However, how it was introduced to the Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the Spanish Empire, which was then allied with France.[8][9]\\nRegardless of origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger, and was predominantly used as a weapon, not just a tool. The quick opening techniques (\"flipping\") were also developed in the Philippines. In contrast, the French pied du roi was primarily a folding ruler, with the knife only included in some specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they also commonly included a metal tang at a right angle from the end of the handle to aid in measuring.[8][9] There were also very similar designs to the balisong produced in England in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the pied du roi. But like the latter they were primarily utilitarian tools.[10]\\nThere are two main types of balisong construction: \"sandwich construction\" and \"channel construction\".\\nSandwich constructed balisong knives are assembled in layers that are generally pinned or screwed together. They allow the pivot pins to be adjusted more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.\\nFor a channel constructed balisong, the main part of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being integrally cast) in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction.\\nAdditionally, the two constructions can be combined to form the \"chanwich construction\", which involves two halves of a channel handle screwed together. Although rare, this construction generally keeps the best elements of both constructions and discards the worst, as it retains the better handle shape channel construction is known for, while still allowing adjustment of the tightness the handles are held together with to some extent, as well as easier access to the inside of the handle for cleaning. One notable example would be the Tsunami from Squid Industries.[11]\\nThere are also three methods of operation balisongs use: bearings, bushings, or only washers.[12]\\nBearing operated balisongs have small ball bearings housed in a circular concavity around the hole in the pivot. These bearings allow the handles of the balisong to rotate.\\nBushing operated balisongs have a small metal bushing slightly thicker than the tang in each pivot hole with a usually bronze disc known as a washer on each side. These washers clamp down on the bushing, but not on the tang, when the pivot screw is tightened, allowing the handle to rotate around the tang.\\nThere are also washer-only operated balisongs which are usually much cheaper and lower quality than the other kinds, as they don\\'t need bushings, but the handles will always bind to the tang when the screws are tightened enough and the washers, tang and handles all wear themselves down much faster due to the increased friction.\\nSome of the blades of traditional butterfly knives in the Philippines were made from steel taken from railroad tracks thus giving them a decent amount of durability and toughness, while others are made from the recycled leaf springs of vehicles.\\nMost modern balisongs, such as the Benchmade 51, do not use tang pins. Instead, they use \"zen pins\", which are two small pins embedded in the top of the handles of the balisong which make contact with the bottom of the blade. A balisong with zen pins negates the problem of having the tang pins fall out (as is typical of some cheaper models).\\nSome modern balisongs also have a \"pinless\" system, in which they do not have any pins, and instead rely on the material of the handles to make contact with the blade, similar to how zen pins work. One notable example of a pinless balisong would be the Squid Industries Swordfish.[13]\\nThe balisong has been outlawed in several countries, mainly due to its easy utility in crimes and ability to be easily concealed for the same purpose. In some jurisdictions its criminal use is considered a knife crime.\\nBalisong trainers feature a special blunt and unsharpened \"blade\" and are legal in some areas where balisongs are not.\\n'),\n",
       " ('Parrying dagger',\n",
       "  'The parrying dagger is a category of small handheld weapons from the European late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. These weapons were used as off-hand weapons in conjunction with a single-handed sword such as a rapier. As the name implies they were designed to parry, or defend, more effectively than a simple dagger form, typically incorporating a wider guard, and often some other defensive features to better protect the hand as well. They may also be used for attack if an opportunity arises. The general category includes two more specific types, the sword breaker and trident dagger.[1]\\nThe use of this off-hand weapon gradually fell out of favor as sword fighting evolved into the modern sport of fencing. The use of progressively lighter primary weapons such as the small sword, épée, and foil allowed for greater speed since the fencer needed less protection for himself as double hits became more allowed in sport fencing.\\nParrying daggers were an important development of the ubiquitous quillion dagger form, appearing in the early to mid-16th century starting with the so-called left hand dagger. Although this is often used as a term of convenience for parrying daggers in general, it also refers more specifically to the earlier and simpler form of the weapon. It had stout quillons (straight or curved) for effective parrying as well as an additional guard in the form of a ring or shell on one side of the quillons where they crossed the grip. In addition to straight blades, there are examples of left hand daggers with wavy blades, those with saw edges and blades that are perforated along the central fuller with small holes, all designed to make the weapon lighter or to aid in defense.[2] This form of dagger largely disappeared in the early 17th century in favor of the much more important main-gauche which was especially popular in Spain and Italy. The triple dagger and swordbreaker were rare and relatively late developments, first appearing around 1600. Parrying daggers were often made en suite, or similar in terms of construction and decorative technique, to the sword with which they were paired as a companion weapon.[3][4][5]\\nThe main-gauche (French for \"left hand\", pronounced [mɛ̃ ɡoʃ]) was used mainly to assist in defense by parrying enemy thrusts, while the dominant hand wielded a rapier or similar longer weapon intended for one-handed use.[6] It was a relatively large dagger, having a longer and heavier blade (often measuring 19\\xa0in (480\\xa0mm) or slightly more in length) and very long, straight quillons. Its most characteristic feature was a wide knuckleguard that curved from the quillons to the pommel and protected the hand. The guard was usually (but not always) triangular in outline, and the quillons typically measured 11\\xa0in (280\\xa0mm) or more from tip to tip.[3][4][5]\\nSince this style of dagger was usually made en suite with a cup-hilted rapier, the decoration of the knuckleguard tended to reflect that of the cup of the rapier. The edges of the guard are usually turned over toward the outside, possibly to trap the point of the opponent\\'s blade and prevent it from slipping into the defender\\'s hand. The quillons are normally cylindrical with knobbed tips, and in many instances are decorated with spiral fluting. The pommel is normally decorated to match the quillons and made to resemble the pommel of its matching rapier, while the grip is usually made of wood and wrapped with twisted and braided wire.[3][4][5]\\nThe blade is normally made in three distinct sections or zones. The first section, near the hilt, comprises the ricasso (unsharpened portion) which is flat-sided and slightly beveled at the edges with one or two small holes at its forward end. In some examples there are two arms running parallel to the sides of the ricasso with spaces inbetween, designed to catch the opponent\\'s blade in a manner similar to the curved quillons of a dagger. On the side of the ricasso opposite the knuckleguard there is usually an oval depression for the thumb. The second section of the blade is normally single-edged with a flat triangular cross-section. The edge faces the wielder\\'s left when the dagger is held in the ready position. The back of the blade (the dull edge) in this section is usually filed with a series of grooves or notches. The third and longest section of the blade extends to the point, and is double-edged with a diamond cross-section. It will occasionally have notches or serrations for a short distance along the edge which corresponds to the back of the previous zone. Although this form is typical, numerous variations can be found including those with curved quillons, rounded guards or blades with only two sections. These various forms reached their peak of development in the late 17th century and, despite a period of decline, the weapon continued to be used even into the 18th century.[3][4][5]\\nThe swordbreaker was a dagger that had large, deep serrations along one side of the blade, resembling the barbed teeth of a comb and designed to entrap an opponent\\'s blade, allowing a variety of follow-up techniques. Like the triple dagger, the swordbreaker was a rare form of parrying dagger compared to the main-gauche, partly due to the difficulty of crafting such a specialised weapon. One Italian example dated around 1600 can be found in the Wallace Collection in London and has a hilt consisting of a pair of straight quillons and a ring guard.[3][5][7]\\nDespite the name swordbreaker, it is uncertain whether they could in fact break sword blades as suggested by some scholars,[5][8] as swords of this era were intended to stand up to substantial forces, well in excess of what could be generated by a fighter\\'s off-hand. Swords are sometimes depicted in Fechtbüchern as withstanding a two-handed attempt to break them (or show off their resilience).[9] Late Renaissance rapiers and smallswords may not be as robust as the cutting swords of earlier times, however, and have indeed been known to break on occasion, so the claim may have more veracity in relation to the typical civilian weapons of this period.\\nThe term is also applied in modern times to the various devices (such as hooks or spikes) found on some bucklers which served the same purpose as the parrying dagger to entrap an opponent\\'s blade.[10]\\nTrident daggers (or triple daggers) have blades divided lengthwise into three parts which fold together to resemble a conventional blade. When a mechanism near the hilt is released the two side blades open under spring pressure to form the \"trident\", flying apart until they are stopped by the ends of the curved quillons. This creates a dagger capable of trapping blades more securely and easily. Like the swordbreaker, the triple dagger was a rare form of parrying dagger compared to the main-gauche.[3][5][11]\\nAn off-hand weapon is rarely used in modern sport competition. In fact, the use of the off-hand as a defensive measure is often prohibited by the rules of many sport fighting styles that are common in the Western world today. However, in HEMA (historical European martial arts) Rapier and Dagger is a common sparring method, and backsword and dagger is also practised. Another exception is kendo where the use of two shinai of different size is allowed but uncommon; this style is known as nito-ryu (literally \"two sword-style\"). Several other fighting styles not only incorporate but even promote off-hand weapons, for example classical styles of Filipino Martial Arts which commonly have Espada y Daga or Sword-and-dagger systems.[12] Simultaneous use of two weapons is also frequently featured in fiction, particularly in video games, literature, and other media from the fantasy genre, where it is commonly dubbed \"dual wielding\". In the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), rapier combat makes use of various forms of off-hand device, including parrying daggers, batons, cloaks, and a second sword, which in fencing is termed a \"case of rapier\".\\n'),\n",

       "  'Karl Ruprect Kroenen is a fictional supervillain in the Hellboy comic book series, created by Mike Mignola.\\nIn the comics, Kroenen was a relatively unremarkable Nazi SS scientist, whose most distinguishing characteristic was that he always wore a gas mask and protective bodysuit, which Mignola attributes to a disfiguring accident of some kind.\\nDirector Guillermo del Toro created a significantly expanded biography for the character, to appear as a supervillain in the 2004 film adaptation.\\nA German scientist working for the Nazis, and a member of the Thule Society, Dr. Kroenen became one of the top scientists for Project Ragna Rok, and a close disciple of Grigori Rasputin, along with Ilsa Haupstein and Leopold Kurtz. He was present with Rasputin at the secret ritual in Scotland that brought Hellboy to the world.\\nKroenen, Haupstein, and Kurtz were frozen inside a secret Nazi base, until they were resuscitated by industrialist Roderick Zinco, acting on Rasputin\\'s orders. Kroenen resumed work on several of his former projects, including making an \"Apocalypse Army\" by combining corpses with robotics. He also convinced Zinco to retrieve the head of his colleague, Herman von Klempt, from South America. Kroenen retained an affection for his colleague, though Rasputin had rejected Klempt as unsuitable for Ragna Rok. When Klempt\\'s head was re-animated, he tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin\\'s plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad - and instead to use the Army to retrieve Klempt\\'s work in South America. Overhearing, Kurtz became furious and attacked Klempt\\'s head, screaming, \"Rasputin is master!\" In a panic, Kroenen seized a knife and killed Kurtz. When their plan failed, an enraged Rasputin struck Zinco, who was blinded. Wandering around, Zinco accidentally pressed a self-destruct button in the base, destroying it completely.\\nDespite appearances, Kroenen survived and resurfaced years later with Leopold Kurtz to assist Isiah Marsten in acquiring a vessel from the B.P.R.D. Kroenen assumed the body was intended for Rapustin before learning that Marsten tricked him into resurrecting the Black Flame, escaping the resulting chaos with von Klempt\\'s head. Kroenen was found sometime later by Varvara, who reawakened von Klempt and invited the two men to join her cause in rebuilding Pandemonium on Earth. Kroenen became increasingly skeptical of Varvara, who eventually incinerated him.\\nIn the first film adaptation of Hellboy, director Guillermo del Toro created a significantly expanded biography for Kronen that is mentioned in a series of comic panels in the book Hellboy: The Art of the Movie and the special features of the film\\'s DVD. His character is vaguely amalgamated with Unmensch, a supporting antagonist from Hellboy: Wake the Devil, who is also a cyborg nazi assassin.\\nBorn in 1897 Munich, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen was an opera prodigy with angelic features and blonde hair who toured the capitals of Europe until his career ended once his voice deepened with the onset of puberty. Kroenen demonstrated symptoms of masochism at a very early age, which combined with his perfectionism into an extreme form of \"surgical addiction\" out of self-loathing in his teenage years that led to him conducting brutal experiments on himself: Surgically removing his own eyelids, lips, and his toe- and finger nails. He also designed a tight-fitting gas mask to filter out germs, which he wore almost permanently. He also became quite adept with mechanical devices, believing that fusing mechanical constructs with living bodies would help create perfection. One of his early inventions was a clockwork nightingale that sang a Mozart aria perfectly. A masterful fencer, he also became renowned for his swordsmanship and created his own signature swords.\\nIn 1930, he met the resurrected Rasputin and quickly became his most loyal disciple. He subsequently joined the Nazi Party, and rose quickly through the ranks, joining the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933 and achieving the rank of Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel). He was awarded the Iron Cross for services to the Third Reich, including a tour of duty as commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, where he served with distinction.  Kroenen became head of the Thule Society, a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult. He helped them to spearhead Project Ragna Rok, engineering the portal generator that would conjure the Scarlet Beast, Hellboy, in October 1944.\\nWhen Allied Forces stormed the island off the coast of Scotland where Project Ragna Rok took place, Kroenen killed several of the American soldiers attacking the base, but was distracted by a grenade thrown under the portal device by a young Professor Trevor Bruttenholm. Kroenen tried to retrieve the grenade, but his left hand was blown off, and a length of concrete reinforcing rod (or rebar) impaled him through the chest, severing his spine. Shortly thereafter, he disappeared. After his disappearance, in 1956, an unmarked grave in Romania was found. Dental records identified the remains as those of Kroenen.\\nHowever, Kroenen reappeared in 2004. Thanks to the inexplicable powers of science and black magic, Kroenen \"repaired\" himself with a prosthetic mechanical hand, a steel rod replacing the broken part of his spine and a clockwork heart, operated by a wind-up key implanted in his chest. By cranking the key, he was able to increase his speed and reflexes. After long decades, the blood in his veins dried up completely, leaving only dust, and rendering him virtually invulnerable to gunshot wounds. He could also turn the key to \"switch off\" his body (literally), remaining in a dormant state and appearing dead, until he was reanimated. He used this deceptive technique to infiltrate the BPRD headquarters. After critically wounding BPRD Agent Clay, he faked his own death and lay beside Clay, and they were both taken into the headquarters. Once inside, Kroenen drew Rasputin there, and personally killed the now elderly Professor Bruttenholm, before disappearing with Rasputin.\\nThe BPRD tracked Rasputin to his own mausoleum beneath Moscow. Hellboy seemingly avenged Bruttenholm\\'s death by throwing Kroenen into an impalement trap — a spiked pit hidden beneath a trapdoor. Skewered on the stakes, Kroenen was crushed when Hellboy dropped a giant cog on top of him. It is unknown if Kroenen survived this or not.\\nKroenen\\'s smashed gas mask later appeared in a display case at the BPRD in Hellboy II: The Golden Army. In the script for that film, an epilogue scene was written to be a lead-in for a third movie, but was cut for budgetary reasons. An animated version of the scene appears on the DVD\\'s special features. Found by Roderick Zinco in the mausoleum ruins, Kroenen\\'s remains are brought to a doctor to be revived with advanced alchemy, before traveling to the Arctic into a long abandoned Nazi weapon storage building to insert the disembodied head of Kroenen into a huge robotic body at which point Kroenen awakes and praises his \"Master\" foreseeing his resurrection as Rasputin appears on screen.\\nIn the commentary of Golden Army, Guillermo del Toro also stated that, in the planned story for the third film, Kroenen was to have some history with the character of Johann Krauss. This was hinted in the second film when Johann is seen staring in deep thought at Kroenen\\'s mask in the display case during the part when Hellboy is in the ward.\\nKroenen\\'s comics version is a fairly ordinary scientist, who seems to possess some surgical training.\\nIn the 2004 film and the 2019 film\\'s flashback, the former having him wear an SS uniform with a pair of Katar (कटार)-like daggers concealed in the sleeves, Kroenen wields a Luger P08 pistol. In his later appearances in the 2004 film, he wields a pair of tonfa-style swords along with several other daggers strapped to his suit.\\nCzech actor Ladislav Beran portrayed Kroenen in the 2004 film adaptation of Hellboy.\\nThis portrayal is radically different from the comics. Kroenen, who originally played the part of a meek character, who Del Toro describes as someone who is likely to say \"Aargh! Don\\'t break the machine!\" is here portrayed as a murderous soldier who is inhumanly loyal to Rasputin. The spelling of his middle name was also changed from \"Ruprect\" to \"Ruprecht\".\\nKroenen also appears in the 2019 film reboot, portrayed by Ilko Iliev. He is the one member of Project Ragnarok to escape alive.\\nKroenen is a popular Hellboy villain, who appears on a variety of merchandise. His larger appearance in the 2004 film spawned various merchandise as well. German film historian Florian Evers devotes a whole chapter of his book on National Socialism in modern pop culture to the character of Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. He points out the allegoric puzzle segments of Shoah-iconography behind the design of Kroenen, calling him an incarnation of the Holocaust.[1]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Hawkworld',\n",
       "  'Hawkworld is a comic book series published by American company DC Comics from 1989 to 1993. The initial storyline was published as a three-issue mini-series and then, based on the high sales and interest level generated by this limited series, launched as an ongoing monthly book. Katar Hol and Shayera Thal were rebooted in the prestige format limited series.\\nThe three-issue limited series written and drawn by Timothy Truman and inked by Enrique Alcatena was published in 1989. The ongoing series lasted for four years (1990–1993) and included 32 issues, along with 3 annuals. Timothy Truman contributed to the plotting of the first six issues, which were scripted by John Ostrander. Ostrander was the sole credited writer for the remainder of the series. After the Hawkworld ongoing series ended in 1993, a new series simply named Hawkman (vol. 3) picked up the story line and ran from 1993 to 1996. Ostrander wrote the first six issues of this new series, tying up some dangling plot threads from Hawkworld.\\nKatar Hol was a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, and a child of a privileged family. But his homeworld had the policy to conquer and mine other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realized that this was wrong. He rebelled against the system, and was sent into exile. 10 years later, he escaped and got the help of Shayera Thal, a young officer from a lower class of society, to uncover and defeat the renegade police captain Byth. As a result, Hol was reinstated in the Wingmen Force and given a new partner, Thal.\\nThe primary themes Timothy Truman focused on in the limited series were social inequality and class. When John Ostrander took over the writing duties with the monthly series he continued to develop and expand upon Truman\\'s original ideas. After relocating the setting of the series from Thanagar to the city of Chicago, Katar and Shayera were exposed to the founding documents of the United States as part of their education on America\\'s criminal justice system. Neither characters were familiar with the concept of natural rights and found the contrasts between America\\'s founding principles and the reality of pragmatic governance perplexing. Their different ways of coming to terms with these ideas and the possibility of spreading them back to their home world drove the story lines of the series. Katar was inspired by the possibilities he found in this new way of thinking while Shayera initially rejected them as unrealistic and unworkable. During the series both characters eventually concluded that, much like Thanagar, the United States was also a \"Hawkworld\", a predatory society in which the powerful oppress the weak; despite of it, they came to see American society as offering more long-term hope for social justice through its embrace of natural rights, even if these values were only embraced on a rhetorical level by most.\\nAlong with its contemporaries  The Man of Steel, Batman: Year One, Aquaman Special #1, and Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn, Hawkworld was intended to revise DC Universe continuity for the post-Crisis continuity that explored the origins of the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. However, DC editors decided that it was not just an origin story; rather, it was occurring in the present, concurrently with the rest of DC\\'s output (similar to Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals and The Power of Shazam!). This meant that the Hawks\\' entire history from the Silver Age onward had to be disregarded, including their memberships in the Justice League (including his brief membership in Justice League International). This began a series of nonstop retcons to the Hawkman characters that ended with a new Hawkman returning in the pages of JSA.\\nDuring the Brightest Day storyline  (2010), Hath-Set has collected the bones from all of Carter\\'s and Shiera\\'s past bodies and created from them a portal to Hawkworld. He was followed, however, by Carter and Shiera. While there, it is revealed that Hawkworld is now under the rulership of Shiera\\'s mother, Queen Khea.

This included ending kafala, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employer\\'s permission, effectively trapping workers who were being exploited and abused. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new labour laws.

This led to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar on 5 June 2017.[31][32]\\nQatar voiced support for the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin. Spokeswoman of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lulwah Rashif Al-Khater said that: \"The launching of the Turkish military operation last Saturday was motivated by legitimate concerns related to its national security and the security of its borders, in addition to protecting Syria\\'s territorial integrity from the danger of secession.

The final tournament was held for the first time in Qatar, from 15 January to 1 February 2015. The Qatari bid was selected over those of Norway, Poland and France after a vote by the IHF Council on 27 January 2011, in Malmö, Sweden.[2] \\nThis was the third time that the World Championship was hosted in the Middle East And North Africa, after Egypt in 1999 and Tunisia in 2005. \\nFrance won the final against Qatar 25–22 to win their fifth title,[3] a first in handball history while Qatar won their first ever medal.[4]\\nPoland captured the bronze medal by defeating Spain 29–28 after extra time.[5] Denmark secured the fifth place by winning against Croatia which finished sixth and thus had the worst result in the past 13 years of international handball competing.\\nThe competition was marred by numerous controversies throughout.\\nThe games of the tournament were played in 3 cities: Doha, Al Rayyan and the newly created town of Lusail.\\nThree new venues were constructed for the tournament:\\nTwenty-four teams participated in the final tournament. Qatar, as hosts and Spain, as world champions, were automatically qualified, which left 22 places available for the best teams of each continental qualification tournament and the winners of an additional European qualification competition.\\nIn a decision taken by the International Handball Federation on 8 July 2014 the spot allocated for a nation from Oceania was revoked on the grounds that Oceania has no continental confederation. The national team, qualified for this spot through the 2014 Oceania Handball Championship, was Australia. The spot was instead handed out as a wild card to the nation with the highest ranking at the previous world championships not qualified for the Qatar tournament. This nation was Germany.[7] Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates withdrew on 7 November 2014.[8][9] Iceland and Saudi Arabia were chosen as the replacements.[10]\\nThe draw was held on 20 July 2014 at 21:30 local time in Doha, Qatar.[11][12]\\nThe seedings were published on 11 July 2014.[13]\\nEach team selects 16 players for the tournament.\\n18 referee pairs are selected:[14]\\n\\nThe schedule was published on 21 August 2014.[15][16] A new schedule was released on 12 December 2014.[17][18] The top four teams from each group advanced to the knockout stage.\\nFor the group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group tied on an equal number of points, the finishing positions will be determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:[19]\\nAll times are local (UTC+3).\\nFT: 24–24\\xa0ET: 5–4 \\n\\nFT: 27–27\\xa0Pen: 3–1 \\nFT: 28–28\\xa0Pen: 3–4 \\nSource: IHF.info\\nSource: IHF.info\\nFranceFifth title\\nWilliam Accambray, Igor Anić, Xavier Barachet, Cyril Dumoulin, Jérôme Fernandez, Mathieu Grébille, Michaël Guigou, Samuel Honrubia, Guillaume Joli, Luka Karabatic, Nikola Karabatić, Kentin Mahé, Daniel Narcisse, Alix Nyokas, Thierry Omeyer, Valentin Porte, Cédric SorhaindoHead coach: Claude Onesta\\nAll-Star Team of the tournament:[1]\\n\\nThe final rankings were used in the 2016 Summer Olympics qualification process.

Further, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates withdrew.[7][8][9]\\nA large number of players in the Qatar team had been naturalised in the years leading up to the championship. According to IHF rules, to gain eligibility for a new national team, a player cannot have played for another nation for three years in an official match.[20][21] This allowed several foreign-born players, including Spanish-born Borja Vidal, Goran Stojanović and Jovo Damjanović from Montenegro, and Bertrand Roiné who previously played for France, to play for the Qatar team at the championship. According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, only four of the 17 players in the squad were native to Qatar.[22]\\nHead of the Qatar Handball Federation, Ahmed Mohammed Abdulrab Al Shaabi, acknowledged the policy in a statement in June 2013, saying \"We\\'re a small nation with limited human resources, so we had to bring players from outside in the past.\" He also announced an end to the policy at the time, adding however that they \"[might] make an exception only in the case of an experienced goalkeeper.\"[23] In January 2014, Danish sports agent Mads Winther said he had met with \"contacts involved with Qatar\" regarding the possibility of naturalising Danish players.[24]\\nThe practice was criticised by Austrian goalkeeper after his team\\'s loss to Qatar in the round of 16, saying \"It [felt] like playing against a world selection team\" and \"I think it is not the sense of a world championship.\"[25] At a press conference during the championship, Qatar head coach Valero Rivera declined to comment on the matter.[25] Spanish player Joan Cañellas did not think it was an issue, saying \"If they can do it, why not.\"[21]\\nAfter the controversial semi-final against Poland, and reaching the final as a result, the practice was even more criticised, with players such as Danijel Šarić having now represented four different national teams.[26]\\nQatar flew in about 60 Spanish fans to cheer for Qatar during the championship.[27]\\nDuring the first 12 matches of the tournament, 143 two-minute suspensions were awarded by the referees, a figure that came under strong criticism from teams, who had not been informed of the IHF Referee Committee\\'s instructions to referees commanding them to keep a strict disciplinary line.[28]\\nThe referees were widely accused of being one-sided in favour of the hosts.

       " ('Tamil culture',\n",
       "  '\\nTamil culture is the culture of the Tamil people. Tamil culture is rooted in the arts and ways of life of Tamils in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and across the globe. It has a long history of diversified heritage and cultural distinctions.\\nTamils have a strong attachment to the Tamil language, which is often venerated in literature as \"Tamil̲an̲n̲ai\", \"the Tamil mother\".[2]  It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Tamil identity.[3] Like the other languages of South India, it is unrelated to the Indo-European languages of northern India. The Tamil language preserves many features of Proto-Dravidian, though modern-day spoken Tamil in Tamil Nadu freely uses loanwords from Sanskrit and English and vice versa. Also, the language does not have many commonly used alphabets in English language and Hindi (a product of Sanskrit and written in Devanagri script).[4] Tamil literature is of considerable antiquity, and is recognised as a classical language by the government of India. Classical Tamil literature, which ranges from lyric poetry to works on poetics and ethical philosophy, is remarkably different from contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages, and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South-east Asia.[5]\\nThe ancient Tamil grammatical work of the Tolkappiyam and the Sangam works of the Ten Idylls (Pattuppāṭṭu) and the Eight Anthologies (Eṭṭuttokai) shed light on early religion of ancient Dravidian people. Thirumal is indicated to be the deity associated with the mullai tiṇai (pastoral landscape) in the Tolkappiyam.[6][7] He is regarded to be the only deity who enjoyed the status of Paramporul (achieving oneness with Paramatma) during the Sangam age. He is also known as Māyavan, Māmiyon, Netiyōn, and Māl in Sangam literature.[8] A reference to \"Mukkol Pakavars\" in Sangam literature indicates that only Vaishnava saints were holding Tridanda and were prominent during the period. Tirumal was glorified as \"the supreme deity\", whose divine lotus feet could burn all evil and grant moksha. During the post-Sangam period, his worship was further glorified by the poet-saints called the Alvars.[9][10]\\nMurugan was glorified as, the god of war, who is ever young and resplendent, as the favoured god of the Tamils.[11] Sivan was also seen as the supreme God.[11] Early iconography of Murugan[12] and Shiva[13] and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization.[14][15] The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, thinais, based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these thinai had an associated deity such as Thirumal in Mullai-the forests, Murugan in kurinji -the Hills and Venthan in Marutham-the plains,Kotravai in Palai-the desert and Wanji-ko/kadalon in the Neithal-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were Mayyon who were all assimilated into Hinduism over time.\\nThe Ramavataram or Kamba Ramayanam of Kamban is an epic of about 11,000 stanzas.[16][17] The Rama-avataram or Rama-kathai as it was originally called was accepted into the holy precincts in the presence of Vaishnava Acharya Naathamuni.[18]Kamba Ramayana is not a verbal translation of the Sanskrit epic by Valmiki, but a retelling of the story of Rama.[18]\\nThe Ramavataram or Kamba Ramayanam of Kamban is an epic of about 11,000 stanzas.[16][full citation needed][17][unreliable source?] The Rama-avataram or Rama-kathai as it was originally called was accepted into the holy precincts in the presence of Vaishnava Acharya Naathamuni.[18][full citation needed]\\nAbout 88%[19] of the population of Tamil Nadu are Hindus. Christians and Muslims account for 6% and 5.5% respectively.[19] The majority of Muslims in Tamil Nadu speak Tamil,[20] with less than 15% of them reporting Urdu as their mother tongue.[21] Tamil Jains number only a few thousand now.[22] Atheist, rationalist, and humanist philosophies are also adhered by sizeable minorities, as a result of Tamil cultural revivalism in the 20th century, and its antipathy to what it saw as Brahminical Hinduism.[23]\\nTamil Jains constitute around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu.[19] Many of the rich Tamil literature works were written by Jains.[24] According to George L. Hart, the legend of the Tamil Sangams or \"literary assemblies\" was based on the Jain sangham at Madurai.[25]\\nThe most popular deity is Murugan, he is known as the patron god of the Tamils and is also called \"Tamil Kadavul\" (Tamil God).[26][27] In Tamil tradition, Murugan is the youngest son and Ganesha/Pillayar is the eldest son of Shiva/Sivan, and it is different from the North Indian tradition, which represents Murugan as the eldest son. The goddess Parvati is often depicted as a goddess with a green skin complexion in Tamil Hindu tradition. The worship of Amman, also called Mariamman, is thought to have been derived from an ancient mother goddess, and is also very common.[28] Kan̲n̲agi, the heroine of the Cilappatikār̲am, is worshipped as Pattin̲i by many Tamils, particularly in Sri Lanka.[29] There are also many followers of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu, mainly in the southern districts.[30] In addition, there are many temples and devotees of Vishnu, Siva, Ganapathi, and the other Hindu deities.\\nMuslims across Tamil Nadu follow Hanafi and Shafi\\'i schools. Erwadi in Ramanathapuram district and Nagore in Nagapattinam district[31] are the major pilgrimage centres for Muslims in Tamil Nadu.\\nIn rural Tamil Nadu, many local deities, called aiyyan̲ārs, are thought to be the spirits of local heroes who protect the village from harm.[32] Their worship often centres around nadukkal, stones erected in memory of heroes who died in battle. This form of worship is mentioned frequently in classical literature and appears to be the surviving remnants of an ancient Tamil tradition.[33]\\nThe Saivist sect of Hinduism is significantly represented amongst Tamils, more so among Sri Lankan Tamils, although most of the Saivist places of religious significance are in northern India. The Alvars and Nayanars, who were predominantly Tamils, played a key role in the renaissance of Bhakti tradition in India. In the 10th century, the philosopher Ramanuja, who propagated the theory of Visishtadvaitam, brought many changes to worshipping practices, creating new regulations on temple worship, and accepted lower-caste Hindus as his prime disciples.[34]\\nThe most important Tamil festivals are Pongal, a harvest festival that occurs in mid-January, and Puthandu, the Tamil New Year, which occurs on 14 April. Both are celebrated by almost all Tamils, regardless of religion. The Hindu festival Deepavali is celebrated with fanfare; other local Hindu festivals include Thaipusam, Panguni Uttiram, and Adiperukku. While Adiperukku is celebrated with more pomp in the Cauvery region than in others, the Ayyavazhi Festival, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, is predominantly celebrated in the southern districts of Kanyakumari District, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi.[35]\\nVarious martial arts including Adimurai, Kuttu Varisai, Varma Kalai, Silambam, Adithada, Malyutham and Kalarippayattu, are practised in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.[36] The warm-up phase includes yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. Silambam originated in ancient Tamilakam and was patronized by the Pandyans, Cholas and Cheras, who ruled over this region. Silapathigaram, a Tamil literature from the 2nd century CE, refers to the sale of Silamabam instructions, weapons and equipment to foreign traders.[37] Since the early Sangam age, there was a warlike culture in South India. War was regarded as an honourable sacrifice and fallen heroes and kings were worshipped in the form of a Hero stone. Each warrior was trained in martial arts, and horse riding and specialized in two of the weapons of that period Vel (spear) Val (sword) and Vil (bow).[38] Heroic martyrdom was glorified in ancient Tamil literature. The Tamil kings and warriors followed an honour code similar to that of Japanese Samurais and committed suicide to save their honor. The forms of martial suicide were known as Avipalli, Thannai, Verttal, Marakkanchi, Vatakkiruttal and Punkilithu Mudiyum Maram. Avipalli was mentioned in all the works except Veera Soliyam. It was a self-sacrifice of a warrior to the goddess of war for the victory of his commander. The Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka reflected some elements of Tamil martial traditions which included worship of fallen heroes (Maaveerar Naal) and practice of martial suicide. They carried a Suicide pill around their neck to escape the captivity and torture.[39] A remarkable feature besides to their willingness to sacrifice is, that they were well-organized and disciplined. It was forbidden for the rebels to consume tobaccos, alcohols, drugs and to have sexual relationships.[40]\\nThe Wootz steel originated in South India and Sri Lanka.[41][42]  There are several ancient Tamil, Greek, Chinese and Roman literary references to high-carbon Indian steel since the time of Alexander\\'s India campaign. The crucible steel production process started in the sixth century BCE, at production sites of Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Sri Lanka and exported globally; the Tamils of the Chera Dynasty producing what was termed the finest steel in the world, i.e. Seric Iron to the Romans, Egyptians, Chinese and Arabs by 500 BCE.[43][44][45] The steel was exported as cakes of steely iron that came to be known as \"Wootz.\"[46]\\nThe Tamilakam method was to heat black magnetite ore in the presence of carbon in a sealed clay crucible inside a charcoal furnace. An alternative was to smelt the ore first to give wrought iron, then heated and hammer to be rid of slag. The carbon source was bamboo and leaves from plants such as Avārai.[46][47] The Chinese and locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Tamils by the 5th century BCE.[48][49] In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel and production sites from antiquity have emerged, in places such as Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama and Samanalawewa, as well as imported artefacts of ancient iron and steel from Kodumanal. A 200 BCE Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artefacts and production processes to the island from the classical period.[50][51][52][53] The Arabs introduced the South Indian/Sri Lankan wootz steel to Damascus, where an industry developed for making weapons of this steel. The 12th-century Arab traveller Edrisi mentioned the \"Hinduwani\" or Indian steel as the best in the world.[54][41] Another sign of its reputation is seen in a Persian phrase\\xa0– to give an \"Indian answer\", meaning \"a cut with an Indian sword.\"[49] Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe and the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East.[49]\\nTamil martial arts also include various types of weapons.\\nMost traditional arts are religious in some form and usually, centres on Hinduism, although the religious element is often only a means to represent universal—and, occasionally, humanist—themes.[56]\\nThe most important form of Tamil painting is Tanjore painting, which originated in Thanjavur in the 9th century. The painting\\'s base is made of cloth and coated with zinc oxide, over which the image is painted using dyes; it is then decorated with semi-precious stones, as well as silver or gold thread.[57] A style which is related in origin, but which exhibits significant differences in execution, is used for painting murals on temple walls; the most notable example are the murals on the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam and the Brihadeeswarar temple of Tanjore.[58]\\nTamil sculpture ranges from elegant stone sculptures in temples, to bronze icons with exquisite details.[59] The medieval Chola bronzes are considered to be one of India\\'s greatest contributions to the world art.,[60][61] Unlike most Western art, the material in Tamil sculpture does not influence the form taken by the sculpture; instead, the artist imposes his/her vision of the form on the material.[62] As a result, one often sees in stone sculptures flowing forms that are usually reserved for metal.[63]\\nTamil country has its own music form called Tamil Pannisai, from which current Carnatic music evolved. Has its own music troops like Urumi melam, Pandi melam (present day\\'s chenda melam), Mangala Vathiyam, and Kailaya vathiyam etc.,. Ancient Tamil works, such as the Silappatikaram, describe a system of music,[64] and a 7th-century Pallava inscription at Kudimiyamalai contains one of the earliest surviving examples of Indian music in notation.[65] Contemporary dance forms such as Bharatanatyam have recent origins but are based older temple dance forms known as Sadirattam as practised by courtesans and a class of women known as Devadasis[66]\\nFamous Tamil dance styles are\\nContemporary dance forms such as Bharatanatyam have recent origins but are based on older temple dance forms known as Catir Kacceri as practised by courtesans and a class of women known as Devadasis[66]\\nOne of the Tamil folk dances is karakattam. In its religious form, the dance is performed in front of an image of the goddess Mariamma.[67] The kuravanci is a type of dance-drama, performed by four to eight women. The drama is opened by a woman playing the part of a female soothsayer of the kurava tribe(people of hills and mountains), who tells the story of a lady pining for her lover. The therukoothu, literally meaning \"street play\", is a form of village theatre or folk opera. It is traditionally performed in village squares, with no sets and very simple props.[68] The performances involve songs and dances, and the stories can be either religious or secular.[69] The performances are not formal, and performers often interact with the audience, mocking them, or involving them in the dialogue. Therukkūthu has, in recent times, been very successfully adapted to convey social messages, such as abstinence and anti-caste criticism, as well as information about legal rights, and has spread to other parts of India.[70] Tamil Nadu also has a well-developed stage theatre tradition, which has been influenced by western theatre. A number of theatrical companies exist, with repertoires including absurdist, realist, and humorous plays.[71]\\nThe theatrical culture flourished in Tamil culture during the classical age. Tamil theatre has a long and varied history whose origins can be traced back almost two millennia to dance-theatre forms like Kotukotti and Pandarangam, which are mentioned in an ancient anthology of poems entitled the Kalingathu Parani.[72]\\nThe predominant theatre form of the region is Kattaikkuttu, where performers (historically men) sing, act, dance and are accompanied by musicians on traditional instruments. The majority of performances draw from stories in the Mahabharata, while a few plays take their inspiration from Purana stories.\\nThe modern Tamil film industry originated during the 20th century. The Tamil film industry has its headquarters in Chennai and is known under the name Kollywood, it is the second largest film industry in India after Bollywood.[73] Films from Kollywood entertain audiences not only in India but also overseas Tamil diaspora. Tamil films from Chennai have been distributed to various overseas cinemas in Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.[74] Inspired by Kollywood originated outside India Independent Tamil film production in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Canada, and western Europe. Several Tamil actresses such as Anuisa Ranjan Vyjayanthimala, Hema Malini, Rekha Ganesan, Sridevi, Meenakshi Sheshadri, and Vidya Balan have acted in Bollywood and dominated the cinema over the years. Historical chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, including M. G. Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi and J. Jayalalithaa, were previously successful personalities in the Tamil film industry.\\nIn Ancient times, two bullfighting and bull-racing sports were conducted. 1.Manjuvirattu and 2. Yeruthazhuval.  These sports were organised to keep the people\\'s temperament always fit and ready for war at any time. Each has its own techniques and rules. These sports acted as one of the criteria to marry girls of warrior families. There were traditions where the winner would be chosen as a bridegroom for their daughter or sister.[citation needed]\\nGandhirajan, a post-graduate in Art History from Madurai-Kamaraj University, said the ancient Tamil tradition was \"manju virattu\" (chasing bulls) or \"eruthu kattuthal\" (lassoing bulls) and it was never \"jallikattu,\" that is baiting a bull or controlling it as the custom obtained today. In ancient Tamil country, during the harvest festival, decorated bulls would be let loose on the \"peru vazhi\" (highway) and the village youth would take pride in chasing them and outrunning them. Women, elders and children would watch the fun from the sidelines of the \"peru vazhi\" or streets. Nobody was injured in this. Or the village youth would take delight in lassoing the sprinting bulls with \"vadam\" (rope). It was about 500 years ago, after the advent of the Nayak rule in Tamil Nadu with its Telugu rulers and chieftains, that this harmless bull-chasing sport metamorphosed into \"jallikattu,\" according to Gandhirajan.[75]\\nThe ancient Tamil art of unarmed bullfighting, popular amongst warriors in the classical period,[76][77] has also survived in parts of Tamil Nadu, notably Alanganallur near Madurai, where it is known as Jallikattu and is held once a year around the time of the Pongal festival.\\n'),\n",

       " ('Zatanna',\n",
       "  'Zatanna Zatara (/zəˈtænə zəˈtɑːrə/), commonly known mononymously as Zatanna, is a fictional magician appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Murphy Anderson, and first appeared in Hawkman #4 (November 1964).[1]\\nZatanna holds the distinction of being the daughter of the renowned magician Zatara and belonging to the homo magi race, a unique subset of humanity endowed with innate magical abilities. Widely recognized for her exceptional skills as a professional illusionist, she captivates audiences with her mesmerizing performances with both stage and actual magic. In addition to her stage persona, Zatanna assumes the mantle of a mystic superhero, wholeheartedly dedicating herself to the quest of thwarting malevolent forces. Zatanna\\'s extensive understanding of magic and her proficiency in wielding its powers have established her as a highly sought-after consultant in matters pertaining to the arcane arts. Her expertise, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has led to her assuming prominent roles within the DC Universe. Notably, she has taken up leadership positions in both the contemporary Justice League, a renowned superhero team, and its offshoot branch, the Justice League Dark, which specializes in confronting supernatural threats. This recognition as one of the foremost practitioners of magic solidifies Zatanna\\'s standing as a prominent figure in the DC Universe.[2][3]\\nZatanna has appeared in several different media adaptations, including appearing in several television series in the DC Animated Universe, notably voiced by Julie Brown and Jennifer Hale. She has also appeared as a recurring character in the final three seasons of Smallville, portrayed by actress Serinda Swan. A younger version of the character also appears in Young Justice and Justice League Action, voiced by Lacey Chabert, and in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.\\nCreated by writer Gardner Fox and artist Murphy Anderson, Zatanna first appeared in Hawkman #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father Zatara who made his first appearance in Action Comics #1 but had not been published regularly for several years.[4] The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of Justice League of America, also written by Fox.\\nZatanna is the daughter of magician Giovanni \"John\" Zatara who appeared in Golden Age comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical species Homo magi. Her younger cousin, the teenager Zachary Zatara, is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage illusionist prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father\\'s costume but substituting fishnet stockings and high heels for slacks. Zatanna\\'s search for her father was the subject of a storyline[5] which was featured in several titles edited by Julius Schwartz,[6] and in it, Zatanna interacts with Hawkman and Hawkgirl;[7] battles Batman and Robin while in disguise as a witch and under the control of the villain the Outsider;[8] and teams with the Atom,[9] Green Lantern,[10] and the Elongated Man.[11] The series culminated in Justice League of America #51 (February 1967).[12] This Justice League adventure took place during the Batman television craze when Batman was at the height of his popularity. The premise that the witch in Detective Comics #336 was Zatanna was perceived as an attempt to get Batman participating in this issue of Justice League of America no matter how vague the connection to Zatanna\\'s quest was.[13]\\nShe briefly was featured in backup features in Adventure Comics and Supergirl from 1971 to 1973.[14][15] Zatanna assists the Justice League of America on a few missions[16][17] before being elected to membership in Justice League of America #161 (Dec. 1978).[5][18] Soon after Zatanna joined the group, the identity of her mother was revealed in a multi-issue storyline.[19] Zatanna teamed with Superman in DC Comics Presents[20] and with Batman in The Brave and the Bold.[21] A ten-page short story in DC Special Blue Ribbon Digest #5 (Nov.–Dec. 1980) revealed new details about Zatara\\'s origin and how Zatanna\\'s quest to locate her father began.[22][23] During her tenure with the Justice League, her power level diminishes, so that she can only control the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water.[24] She starred in a backup feature in World\\'s Finest Comics #274–278[14] and the limitation of her powers is reversed in World\\'s Finest Comics #277 (March 1982).[25] She assists Wonder Woman and several other superheroines in fighting an extraterrestrial threat.[26] Zatanna once elected as the Justice League chairperson via votes.\\nAt the conclusion of Alan Moore\\'s Swamp Thing \"American Gothic\" storyline[27] (which was tied to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths), John Constantine comes to get Zatanna, Mento and Sargon the Sorcerer to come together to help demonic and divine forces in other hellish dimensions battle the entity known as the \\'Great Evil Beast\\'. The séance is held at Wintersgate Manor, the home of Baron Winters in Georgetown, Washington D.C., which is also a temporal threshold to other planes of reality. Because Constantine had previously taken Zatanna to a \"tantric studies meeting\", Zatara will not let Zatanna out of his sight with Constantine present and, by his very presence, is forced to take part in the seance to which he was not invited. The Beast, which is so tall that its thumb alone looms over Hell, takes notice of their group twice. The first glimpse dooms Sargon, whom Zatara convinces to \\'die like a sorcerer\\' and not break the holding of hands. Sargon burns to death nobly. The second glimpse starts to literally heat up Zatanna. Zatara willingly takes the effect onto himself, dying (his smoldering hat lands on the table), but sparing his daughter\\'s life.[28]\\nZatanna starred in a special solo one-shot in 1987 that featured Zatanna exploring her mother Sindella\\'s background and battling the villainous sorceress Allura.[29] In Neil Gaiman\\'s The Books of Magic limited series, Zatanna becomes friends and even temporary guardian to Timothy Hunter, a boy destined to become the greatest wizard in the world,[30] and his girlfriend Molly who at the time was cursed by the Queen of the Fairies and unable to touch anything in the human world, including the ground. After a brief stay, she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures. In 1993, Zatanna starred in her first solo limited series, titled Zatanna: Come Together, which saw her summoning her mother\\'s spirit and battling the sorcerer Tannarak and a demon called Xaos.\\nWhen the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing Aquaman, an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including Jason Blood as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as Gamemnae, an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader Nightwing attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae\\'s quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae\\'s power.\\nZatanna starred in another solo one-shot in 2003, Zatanna: Everyday Magic, in which she fought Nimue Ravensong, a magic-user jealous of Zatanna\\'s ability to use magic naturally and without committing sacrifices. Nimue seduced and cursed John Constantine, leading Zatanna into conflict with the wannabe sorceress.[31] In the 2004 limited series Identity Crisis, Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain Doctor Light rapes the Elongated Man\\'s wife, Sue Dibny. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members\\' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light\\'s memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light\\'s mind sparks a debate among the team\\'s members: should the villain\\'s personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime. Zatanna, Hawkman, and the Atom (Ray Palmer) vote for such action, while Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Green Lantern vote against. The Flash (Barry Allen) breaks the tie. Zatanna mind-wipes Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.[32] In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman\\'s memories of the incident as well.\\nHer working relationship to Batman sours after he remembers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s Lazarus Pits, she asks him why he came to her and Batman says: \"I needed someone I could trust. But I had to settle for you\". After Infinite Crisis, their relationship appears to have warmed; in Detective Comics #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming the Penguin. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, \"Zee\".\\nCatwoman discovers that Zatanna\\'s mind-wipe of Dr. Light in Identity Crisis is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman\\'s journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna\\'s mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman shoves Zatanna out a window. Zatanna parry the next attack from Catwoman and freeze her, before apologize and leaving her.\\nA 2005 four-issue Zatanna limited series was published as part of Grant Morrison\\'s Seven Soldiers event.[33] In it, at a support group for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father\\'s tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a shapeshifter named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This trauma, combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, Misty Kilgore, she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a plague to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his \"greatest spell and gift to the world\". In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.\\nIn Detective Comics #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna\\'s father was a friend of Thomas Wayne. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends, although Batman believes that he has never met her in Justice League of America #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the Joker in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker\\'s scheme, driving Joker insane in the process. Bruce puts Zatanna\\'s betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.\\nOn the \"Roll Call\" of Justice League of America #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with the Red Tornado\\'s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of Amazo. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.[34] After that Wonder Woman throws off Amazo\\'s concentration and free Zatanna. Zatanna then defeats Amazo once and for all by using the Red Tornado\\'s soul. Following this battle, Zatanna rejoins the team.[35]\\nZatanna later accompanies Firestorm, Black Lightning, and Batman to Metropolis after they come to believe Kimiyo Hoshi has been kidnapped by agents of the covert metahuman team known as the Shadow Cabinet.[36][37] After a brief conflict, Zatanna and the others are informed by teenage superheroine Rocket that Kimiyo\\'s perceived abduction was actually a misunderstanding caused by the Shadow Cabinet\\'s mission to seek out her help in dealing with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker.[38][39] With assistance from Hardware and Icon, Zatanna and her comrades are able to defeat Starbreaker in a battle in the Himalayas.[40][41][42]\\nIn Gotham City Sirens Zatanna is visited and restrained by Poison Ivy, who interacts via a tree and asks her if her encounter with Catwoman changed Selina in any way.[43]\\nZatanna takes a leave of absence from the JLA, only to reappear during a battle with Despero. Once he is defeated, Zatanna informs the League of the apocalyptic events of the Blackest Night taking place across the globe.[44] After taking the team to the Hall of Justice to find Firestorm, she is forced to fight the undead form of her father, continually pitting the black magic he wields against her own;[45] it is implied she was successful in banishing the Black Lantern, but was left psychologically crushed from having to kill her father again.[46] In the aftermath of Blackest Night, Kimiyo mentions that Zatanna is one of the members who has left the team.[47]\\nIn May 2010 Zatanna received her own solo series, written by Paul Dini and drawn by Stéphane Roux. No longer an active member of the JLA, Zatanna is asked by officer Dale Colton to help solve a murder case at a restaurant frequented by mobsters. Zatanna informs Dale that the murderer was a powerful sorcerer known as Brother Night, who rules the supernatural crime scene in San Francisco. After Zatanna shows up at Night\\'s demonic nightclub and threatens him, he responds by calling upon a powerful nightmare demon for help in battling her,[48] but Zatanna defeats and imprisons the demon to aid her later.[49] A crooked casino owner who had made a deal for eternal youth with the demon of avarice by selling the souls of his brides to the demon attempts to use a love potion to win Zatanna\\'s soul.[50] When her cousin Zachary Zatara breaks the spell, the casino owner begs Zatanna to turn him into a soulless lump of gold in order to escape torment in Hell.[51] Aside from Brother Night, Zatanna faces other threats, such as Oscar Hample, a man who tried to murder her when she was a child and was turned into a puppet by her father.[52][53][54][55] The Zatanna series ended with issue #16 (October 2011).\\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC\\'s continuity. Zatanna is one of the main characters in Peter Milligan\\'s Justice League Dark series. She sports a new costume, though she still wears her classic magician\\'s outfit during shows. In the first issue, she learns that Superman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg have been defeated by the Enchantress and volunteers her services to the League.[56]\\nThe Black Canary and Zatanna graphic novel Bloodspell written by Paul Dini and drawn by Joe Quinones was to be released in 2012, but was delayed until May 2014.[57] The story centered around a 16-year-old Black Canary\\'s first meeting Zatanna.[58]\\nZatanna made her first Rebirth appearance in Detective Comics #958, assisting Bruce Wayne in taking out a robot chasing after a cult member. Later on, Zatanna shows Bruce magic. Later Bruce sees her again and asks her to teach him more about magic. Ultimately she declines and wipes his memory.[59] After the conclusion of the main storyline of the DC Rebirth Batwoman series, Zatanna is implied to be an outpatient therapist of sorts for Beth Kane, Kate Kane\\'s twin sister.[60]\\nIn 2018, a new Justice League Dark series began, with a redesigned Zatanna being part of the team.[61] Zatanna travels to Northern Italy to bind a group of demons called Il Osservatori in a story called Zatanna: Sleight of Hand, published in the DC New Talent Showcase 2018 #1.[62]\\nOriginally, the character was portrayed as half human and half homo magi, with her human lineage stemming from her father\\'s side. However, later retellings of Giovanni\\'s background established her as a full homo magi.[63] This updated heritage has persisted in the New 52 onward.[2] Additionally, the character\\'s maternal ancestry was initially hinted to be connected to the demigod Arion, a revered figure in ancient Atlantean history and the Sorcerer Supreme of ancient Atlantis.[64] This connection is later confirmed in the 52 series.[65] Conversely, the character\\'s paternal line makes her a descendant of Leonardo da Vinci and is related to Nostradamus, Alessandro Cagliostro, Nicholas Flamel, and Evan Fulcanelli, making her of French and Italian heritage.[66]\\nWithin the DC Universe, Zatanna is often portrayed as a professional stage magician and holds the esteemed role of a prominent superhero and mystic consultant.[2][3] She first embarked on her superheroic journey as a member of the Justice League, where she primarily contributed her expertise in the realm of mysticism. Over time, Zatanna\\'s contributions and capabilities led to her ascension as the Chairwoman of the Justice League for a time, a position she attained through a democratic process within the storyline, with the character being elected by popular vote.[67]  In recent narratives, Zatanna\\'s portrayal as a highly trusted, longstanding member of the superhero community as well as recognition of her leadership qualities and ability to inspire others from her peers led to her being appointed as a team member in the second iteration of the Justice League Dark, a group dedicated to handling supernatural threats.[68] Zatanna is also considereed a seasoned sorceress, standing among the most powerful practitioners of magic in the DC Universe, rivaling esteemed sorcerers and sorceresses such as different iterations of Doctor Fate,[69][70] Madame Xanadu,[69] and John Constantine.[71] She also currently holds the distinction of being referred to as DC Comics\\'s \"Sorceress Supreme\".[72]\\nIn comics taking place in the mainstream continuity, Zatanna has had various relationships with other DC Characters, including John Constantine (with whom she practiced tantra) and Doctor Thirteen.[73] Zatanna also had a flirtatious relationship with her fellow Justice Leaguer Barry Allen / the Flash shortly after the death of his wife Iris.[74] In The New 52: Futures End timeline, Zatanna is romantically involved with Jason Blood / Etrigan the Demon.[75][76] In the Mystik U universe, Zatanna pursued a romantic relationship with Sebastian Faust, the son of infamous sorcerer Felix Faust.[77]\\nShe has a strong friendship with Batman due to their shared (retconned) pasts. In Detective Comics #843-844, Zatanna and Bruce briefly discuss the possibility of having a more meaningful relationship. Both later concede that Bruce is too devoted to his cause as Batman to give her the relationship she wishes for, but the pair reaffirm their bond as close friends. Catwoman once considered Zatanna a more dangerous contender for Bruce\\'s attentions than Jezebel Jet, his fiancé at the time.[78] A pep talk between the two women confirms how Zatanna really meant, during the fateful discussion with Bruce, to explore the possibility of a true romance, but turned out quietly resigned to the role of best friend and confidant. Claiming to act on Bruce\\'s best interest, she pushes Selina into confessing her feelings to Bruce, thus stealing him from Jezebel Jet before it is too late.[79]\\nIn mainstream media, DC Animated Universe touches on Bruce and Zatanna\\'s closeness depicted as her having had a crush on him while he trained under her father as \"John Smith\", though she later found out his real name. Decades later, an elderly Bruce is shown to still care for her as he keeps a picture of her along with pictures of his other love interests in a file in the Batcomputer. In the TV series Young Justice, Zatanna has a flirtatious and possibly romantic friendship with Dick Grayson / Robin during Season 1. Dick later says that they have a \"history\" in Season 2 (five years after Season 1), implying that they dated and eventually broke up but still remained close. In season 4, Artemis mentions that both Zatanna and Raquel dated Dick prior.\\nZatanna\\'s heritage grants her inherent magical abilities and a profound command over mystical and cosmic forces believed to originate from the ancient depths of the universe.[1] Typically, Zatanna employs a unique method of spellcasting known as \"Logomancy,\" which involves speaking backwards to invoke mystic effects as a means of concentration and tribute to the Zatara family\\'s method of casting magic. This technique enables her to perform a wide range of magical effects, including teleportation, healing, manipulation of others\\' minds, and many more.[2][80] The character is also proficient in other  conventionally cast forms of magic, including forms of black magic, tarot reading for insight or divination, and once conferred to using mystical objects derived from her parent\\'s collections of mystic artifacts to cast magic. [81]\\nAside from magic, Zatanna is a talented illusionist, showgirl, and stage magician. She has honed her skills in sleight of hand and invented variations of card tricks. Zatanna received combat training from her father and is skilled in hand-to-hand combat. She is adept at escape artistry, capable of freeing herself from straitjackets underwater or between magic show acts.\\nIn her role as a sorceress, Zatanna has access to a diverse array of arcane objects, many of which were amassed by her father and family throughout various generations. These magical artifacts provide her with a notable advantage, as they enable her to harness more conventional forms of magic with ease.[81]\\nShadowcrest Manor serves as the ancestral residence and operational center for Zatanna, which she inherited from her father. The manor has the characteristic of relocating itself to different locations periodically, never remaining in one place for an extended period, and it possesses magical enchantments that render it invisible to ordinary observation.[84]  Access to the manor is restricted and can only be obtained through voice recognition or the utilization of specific magical keys directly associated with Shadowcrest Manor. These keys may be entrusted to trusted allies, including individuals like Batman, granting them entry to the premises.[85]  The manor is also known to possess a degree of sentience, allowing it to carry out the will of Zatanna. It has the ability to expel individuals from the premises, as demonstrated in a notable incident involving Black Mary, who was banished from the manor following a confrontation with Zatanna.[84]  Within Shadowcrest, magical constructs in the form of servants aid Zatanna with various tasks and the maintenance of the house. The manor encompasses distinctive rooms, such as a private library dedicated to supernatural research and the safekeeping of a collection of magical artifacts protected by a mummy named Hassan. Additionally, there is a bestiary room and a changing room that accommodates a vast assortment of outfits personally acquired by Zatanna.[84]\\nThe Curious Abode of Zatanna Zatara is an apartment owned by Zatanna, serving as her publicly accessible residence in Gotham City. It functions as both her personal living space and the central location for her side business, known as \"Zatanna\\'s One-Stop Shop For Magical and Mystical Mayhem and Management.\" Through this establishment, Zatanna provides a variety of magical services, including interdimensional travel and the delivery of mail across different realms. The apartment serves as a means for ordinary individuals to request mystical services. Occasionally, Zatanna receives assistance from Khalid Nassour, the current incarnation of Doctor Fate, in managing incoming calls and providing services to customers.[86]\\nZatanna, as a practitioner of Logomancy, utilizes speech as the primary channel for her magical abilities. This reliance on verbal communication has made her vulnerable to being incapacitated by villains who restrain her through binding and gagging. It is observed that her magical powers tend to increase when unused,[87] but excessive use can deplete them, leading to a strain on her physical well-being. Similar to other magic users, Zatanna can only replenish her waning powers through an extended period of rest. Additionally, there appears to be a connection between Zatanna\\'s powers and her self-confidence. In the narrative Seven Soldiers, a series of significant mistakes left her emotionally and psychologically shattered, rendering her powerless. It was only through the process of restoring her lost confidence that she was able to regain her magical abilities.\\nIn 2022, DC Comics partnered with Webtoon to publish a line of Webtoon-original comics. One of these series is Zatanna and the Ripper, which follows Zatanna as she is transported to the 1800s and must solve and stop the crimes of Jack the Ripper. The series ended in 2023, having published over 50 chapters.\\nThe 1978 DC Super Dictionary invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet. While possessing similar powers, the character was visually distinct from Zatanna, depicting her as a dark-skinned woman in a purple jumpsuit, jackboots, and yellow turban with a long cape.[88]\\nIn the Amalgam Comics universe, Zatanna is merged with the Scarlet Witch of the Avengers to form a character known as Wanda Zatara, the White Witch.[89]\\nIn Batman: Holy Terror, a world where Oliver Cromwell\\'s Church never fell and the United States of America (which now encompasses North America and most of South America) is ruled by a totalitarian religious group known as the Privy Council, Zatanna is an agent of the council. She uses her \\'sin\\' in the service of the state to capture other superhumans, but she is defeated by Batman. While focusing on defeating Barry Allen, Batman throws a gas pellet down her throat.\\nShe appears in JLA: Another Nail, which shows her teaming with Hawkwoman in Midway City.\\nIn the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Zatanna is a member of the Secret Seven and is a member of a motorcycle gang. Her father, Giovanni \"John\" Zatara, is transformed into a motorcycle when Zatanna is riding on him. Zatanna is killed while trying to cast a death spell on Enchantress.[90]\\nIn the DC Bombshells continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker\\'s Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker\\'s Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker\\'s Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells.\\nA college-aged alternate version of Zatanna is the lead character in the DC limited series Mystik U written by Alisa Kwitney and illustrated by Mike Norton. The Zatanna of this continuity enrolls in Mystik University, a school for magic users, alongside other magical DC characters like Enchantress, Sargon the Sorcerer, and her love interest in the series, Sebastian Faust. The students of the school must figure out which of them is destined to betray the others and become a force of evil.[91][77]\\nDC released two stand-alone Zatanna graphic novel titles for its Books for Young Readers program.[92] The first, Zatanna and the House of Secrets, written by Matthew Cody and illustrated by Yoshi Yoshitani, was released in February 2020. The story features a middle-school aged Zatanna who lives in the House of Secrets with her father. Zatanna must protect her pet rabbit, Pocus, from Klarion the Witch Boy, and then rescue her father from Klarion\\'s mother, the Witch Queen.[93][94] The second Zatanna stand-alone young adult title, Zatanna: The Jewel of Gravesend, is written by Alys Arden and illustrated by Jacqueline de Leon. It was released in April 2021, and features a young Zatanna whose \"fun in Luna Park comes to an end when a mystic\\'s quest for a powerful jewel unravels everything Zatanna thought she knew about herself and her beloved neighborhood. Mysteries and magic surround her as she reveals the truth about her family\\'s legacy, and confronts the illusion that has been cast over her entire life\".[95][96]\\n'),\n",

A fugu hiki is similar to the yanagi ba, except that the blade is thinner and more flexible. As the name indicates, the fugu hiki is traditionally used to slice very thin fugu sashimi and is stored separately from the other knives.\\nThe length of the knife is suitable to fillet medium-sized fish.

       "  '\\nPeter Hayden Dinklage (/ˈdɪŋklɪdʒ/; born June 11, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for portraying the role Tyrion Lannister on the HBO television series Game of Thrones (2011–2019), for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series a record four times.[4] He also received a Golden Globe Award in 2011 and a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2020 for the role. Dinklage has a common form of dwarfism known as achondroplasia; he stands 4\\xa0ft 5\\xa0in (1.35\\xa0m) tall. He has used his celebrity status to raise social awareness concerning dwarfism.\\nDinklage studied acting at Bennington College, performing in a number of amateur stage productions. He made his film debut in the black comedy film Living in Oblivion (1995), and had his breakthrough with a starring role in the 2003 comedy-drama The Station Agent. His other films include Elf (2003), Lassie (2005), Find Me Guilty (2006), Penelope (2006), Death at a Funeral (2007), The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008), Death at a Funeral (2010), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023). In 2018, he appeared as Eitri in the Marvel film Avengers: Infinity War and Hervé Villechaize in the biopic film My Dinner with Hervé. He also provided voice-acting for the video game Destiny. In 2023, he voiced Scourge in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.\\nDinklage has also performed in theater, with roles such as the title character in Richard III (2003) at the Public Theatre, Rakitin in A Month in the Country (2015) at Classic Stage Company, and Cyrano de Bergerac in Cyrano at the Daryl Roth Theatre in 2019.\\nDinklage was born on June 11, 1969, either at the Jersey Shore region of New Jersey,[1] or in Morristown, New Jersey,[5][6][7][8] to John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman, and Diane Dinklage, an elementary school music teacher [9] of German and Irish descent. [10] He grew up in the historic Brookside section of Mendham Township, with his parents and older brother Jonathan. He is the only member of his family with achondroplasia.[11][12][13] He was raised  Catholic.[14]\\nAs a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people in their neighborhood. He has described his brother Jonathan as being the \"real performer of the family\", saying that his brother\\'s passion for the violin was the only thing that kept him from pursuing acting.[15] (Jonathan graduated from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and is a violinist and concertmaster for the musical Hamilton.[16][17])\\nDinklage had his first theatrical success in a fifth-grade production of The Velveteen Rabbit. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience\\'s response to the show.[18] He attended Delbarton School, a Catholic preparatory school for boys, where he developed his acting skills.[19] In 1984, he was inspired by a production of the play True West, by American playwright Sam Shepard, to pursue an acting career.[16]\\nHe then attended Bennington College, where he studied for a drama degree and appeared in numerous productions before graduating in 1991.[20][19] He moved to New York City with his friend Ian Bell to build a theater company. Failing to pay the rent, they moved out of their apartment.[16] He lived in New York for 20 years in Williamsburg and the West Village.[21] He then worked at a data-processing company for six years before pursuing a career as a full-time actor.[22]\\nDinklage initially struggled to find acting work, partially because he refused to take the roles typically offered to actors with his condition, such as \"elves or leprechauns\".[16]\\nHe had a credited film debut in the low-budget independent comedy-drama Living in Oblivion (1995), where he starred alongside Steve Buscemi. It tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in New York City. Dinklage\\'s role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles.[23] The next year, he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama Bullet starring rapper Tupac Shakur.[24] Even after his well-received performance in Living in Oblivion, Dinklage could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy 13 Moons (2002). When later interviewed for a theater website, he was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied \"the romantic lead\" who gets the girl.[16]\\nDinklage found his breakthrough playing Finbar McBride, who is a quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film The Station Agent.[16] According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind. Cannavale said McCarthy \"set out to tell a story about a guy who was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world,\" but when McCarthy actually started \"putting pen to paper\" for the screenplay, he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually \"roles written for someone my size are a little flat\"—often either comical or \"sort of Lord of the Rings\" type characters filled with wisdom; further: \"They\\'re not sexual, they\\'re not romantic\" and \"they\\'re not flawed.\" What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has \"romantic feelings\" as well as \"anger and ... flaws.\"[25] The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations.[26][27] In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, \"Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face.\"[28] Besides being Dinklage\\'s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes,[29] The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8\\xa0million against its small budget.[30][31]\\nDinklage later appeared in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman\\'s role as a person with dwarfism.[32][33] According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was \"gorgeous,\" but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a \"rom-com with dwarfs.\"[16] Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, \"There was some flak: \\'Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That\\'s almost like blackface.\\' And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It\\'s Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I\\'m so happy to be here.\"[33]\\nThat year, Dinklage also starred in several off-Broadway productions, such as Richard III.[16][34] Dinklage appeared in the Christmas comedy film Elf as Miles Finch, an irritable children\\'s author who beats up Buddy Hobbs (Will Ferrell) after he mistakes him for an elf.[35] In 2005, he starred in the short-lived CBS science fiction series Threshold and appeared as a wedding planner in the comedy film The Baxter.[36][37] He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama Lassie as a traveling circus performer.[38]\\nIn 2006, Dinklage co-starred with Vin Diesel in Find Me Guilty, a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the true story of the longest Mafia trial in American history; Dinklage played Ben Klandis, the lead defense attorney.[39] Critical reaction to the film was mostly positive, though it was a commercial failure.[40][41] Writing for Chicago Sun-Times, film critic Roger Ebert praised Dinklage\\'s performance, saying that the character he plays stands apart as \"concise, articulate and professional.\"[39] The same year, he portrayed the character Marlowe Sawyer in episodes of Nip/Tuck.[36] He played a fictionalized version of himself in an episode of the HBO series Entourage and appeared in NBC\\'s 30 Rock as Stewart.[36][42] The same year, Dinklage appeared in the British romantic comedy Penelope playing Lemon, a tabloid reporter.[43] The film received mixed reviews from critics.[44]\\nDinklage appeared in the 2007 British comedy film Death at a Funeral, reprising the role in the 2010 American remake;[45][46] the films tell the story of a family trying to deal with a variety of issues after the death of their father.[47] Later in 2007, he played the villainous Simon Bar Sinister in Underdog, which was poorly received, but had some commercial success.[48][49]\\nDinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.[50] The film was considered a box office disappointment compared to the first installment,[51][52] with global revenues of $419.7\\xa0million,[53] and film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage\\'s role as a \"cutesy stereotype he has tried to avoid.\"[54] Later that year, he played the title role in Uncle Vanya (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College\\'s annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus.[55] In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie I Love You Too alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.[56]\\nBetween 2011 and 2019, Dinklage portrayed Tyrion Lannister in HBO\\'s fantasy drama Game of Thrones, an adaptation of author George R. R. Martin\\'s A Song of Ice and Fire novels.[57] Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms.[58] Tyrion is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, and uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life.[59]\\nIn May 2009, he was the first actor to be cast,[60] as showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss noted that Dinklage, whom they described as funny, smart and witty, was their first choice for the role, as the actor\\'s \"core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.\"[16]\\nUnfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, \"he wouldn\\'t play elves or leprechauns\" and was choosy about genre roles. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was \"a different kind of fantasy little person,\" or in the actor\\'s words, \"No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.\"[16] Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because, he said, \"They told me how popular he was.\"[16] Martin said of Dinklage\\'s casting, \"If he hadn\\'t accepted the part, oh, boy, I don\\'t know what we would have done.\"[61] The series proved to be a commercial success; it was renewed for multiple seasons and concluded with its eighth season in May 2019.[62]\\nDinklage received widespread critical praise for his performance. Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe said that Dinklage \"gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.\"[63] Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage\\'s performance has made the character \"all the more popular.\"[64] The Los Angeles Times wrote \"In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage.\"[65] HuffPost called Tyrion the \"most quotable\" character and \"one of the most beloved characters\" of the series.[66]\\nFor his performance, he has gone on to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2019, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.[67][68] As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series\\' second season.[69] In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had once tried to read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, \"George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that.\"[70] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television,[71] although sources differ on the actors\\' per-episode salaries.[a] In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series, a video game based on the show.[73]\\nIn 2012, Dinklage voiced Captain Gutt in Ice Age: Continental Drift.[74] Dinklage said he prepared himself by making sure to rest his voice before the recording sessions as it was his first voice acting role, and that he prefers doing roles he has not done before.[75] After appearing in an episode of NBC\\'s late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live in 2013, Dinklage hosted an episode of the show in April 2016; his appearances included a sketch of him and Gwen Stefani singing a new song called \"Space Pants.\"[76] He received praise for his performance.[76][77]\\nIn 2014, Dinklage starred in the comedy horror film Knights of Badassdom opposite Ryan Kwanten and Steve Zahn. The film is about three best friends that go to the woods and reenact a live action Dungeons & Dragons role play, when they mistakenly conjure up a demon from Hell.[78] The same year, he played the villain Bolivar Trask in the superhero film X-Men: Days of Future Past.[79] In preparation for his role, Dinklage stated that he did not want to approach the character necessarily as a villain, saying that Trask \"actually sees what he\\'s doing as a good thing.\"[80] He also voiced the AI Ghost in the 2014 video game Destiny,[81] but was replaced by Nolan North in August 2015.[82] Executive producer Mark Noseworthy said that it was due to scheduling difficulties caused by Dinklage\\'s other acting commitments.[83]\\nIn 2015, Dinklage starred in the science fiction comedy film Pixels as a former arcade champion named Eddie Plant.[84] According to director Chris Columbus, Plant was partially inspired by Billy Mitchell.[85] The film was critically panned.[86] The Guardian praised Dinklage\\'s performance in an otherwise \"dreary romp\".[87]\\nIn 2016, Dinklage provided the voice of The Mighty Eagle in The Angry Birds Movie,[88] and recorded a song for the musical\\'s soundtrack.[89]\\nHis next release, the independent film Rememory (2017), failed to impress reviewers, but his role of Sam Bloom was praised.[90] Freelance film critic Yasmin Kleinbart stated that \"Dinklage deserves better than this film\" and John DeFore in The Hollywood Reporter said that he \"delivers a soulful lead performance that will attract fans\\' attention.\"[91][92] Also in 2017, Dinklage had a supporting role in the drama-dark comedy film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, from director Martin McDonagh, and the drama Three Christs, both of which played at the Toronto International Film Festival,[93][94][95] with the former receiving widespread critical success.[96] In 2018, Dinklage produced and starred in I Think We\\'re Alone Now, a post-apocalyptic drama based on the companionship between Del, played by Dinklage, and Grace, played by Elle Fanning.[97] The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival,[98] and was later released to theaters on September 14, 2018.[99]\\nIn 2016, Dinklage and his longtime manager David Ginsburg founded their joint-venture production company, Estuary Films. I Think We\\'re Alone Now is the first film under Estuary.[citation needed]\\nDinklage appeared in the 2018 Marvel Studios film Avengers: Infinity War as the character Eitri, a giant dwarf.[100][101][102]\\nDinklage and writer-director Sacha Gervasi spent several years writing and producing a film based on the final days of actor Hervé Villechaize, who died by suicide shortly after his 1993 interview with Gervasi.[103] In 2018, Dinklage starred and played the title role in My Dinner with Hervé.[104][105] The movie was approved by HBO, with Dinklage co-starring alongside Jamie Dornan.[106]\\nIn August and September 2018, he starred in the title role of Cyrano, a stage musical adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac written by his wife Erica Schmidt, with songs by the band The National.[107] He reprised the role in a 2021 film adaptation of the musical, for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.[108]\\nIn 2021, Dinklage portrayed mobster Roman Lunyov in the crime thriller I Care a Lot. His performance was praised, with Tony Sokol favorably comparing his character to Russian mobsters in other media, including Training Day and Orange is the New Black.[109]\\nIn 2023, Dinklage voiced Terrorcon Scourge, the main antagonist in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. He also starred in the romantic comedy-drama film She Came to Me,[110] and played Casca Highbottom in the film The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\\nIn 2017, it was announced that Dinklage has been attached to star in the American comedy O Lucky Day, which is to be directed by Jon S. Baird where he will play a con-man who pretends to be a leprechaun.[111][112]\\nOn October 5, 2017, Dinklage purchased the rights to the film adaptation of Joe R. Lansdale\\'s novel The Thicket.[113]\\nIn 2020, it was announced Dinklage will voice Hitpig in the upcoming animated film Hitpig.[114] More recently, his production company Estuary Films signed a first look deal with Entertainment One.[115]\\nIn 2005, Dinklage married Erica Schmidt, a theater director. They have two children: a daughter born in 2011[116][117] and a son born in 2017.[118][119]\\nDinklage\\'s face was injured in the early 1990s, when he was in a \"punk-funk-rap\" band called Whizzy. It gave him a scar that runs from his neck to his eyebrow. He was playing at the nightclub CBGB in New York City, where he was accidentally kneed in the face and started bleeding on the stage.[15]\\nIn 2008, Dinklage described himself as a lapsed Catholic.[120]\\nDinklage has been a vegetarian since the age of 16, and vegan since 2014.[121] An advocate for animal rights,[122] he supports Farm Sanctuary and has served as the spokesman for the organization\\'s Walk for Farm Animals.[121] He also narrated the video Face your Food, a film on behalf of PETA advocating a vegan diet on ethical grounds.[121] He appeared in another PETA campaign, asking Game of Thrones fans to adopt from shelters rather than to buy huskies that might look like direwolves.[123]\\nIn 2017, Dinklage attended the Women\\'s March demonstration in Park City, Utah, to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues.  \\nDinklage has a form of dwarfism, achondroplasia, a genetic disorder which affects bone growth. As a result, he is 4\\xa0feet 5\\xa0inches (1.35\\xa0m) tall, with an average-sized head and torso but shorter than average limbs.[2][3] While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he sometimes found it challenging when growing up.[11] In 2003, he said that when he was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he \"just has to have a sense of humor,\" to know \"that it\\'s not your problem. It\\'s theirs.\"[34]\\nWhen asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as \"a spokesman for the rights of little people,\" Dinklage responded: \"I don\\'t know what I would say. Everyone\\'s different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I\\'m seemingly okay with it, I can\\'t preach how to be okay with it.\"[103] Despite his own sentiment about the matter, Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.[124][125]\\nAt the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won the award for Best Supporting Actor\\xa0– Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the audience that he had been thinking about \"a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson,\" and suggested that they Google his name.[126] Henderson was a man with dwarfism from Somerset, England, who was badly injured after being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson\\'s name being trended worldwide on social media. Henderson eventually died of his injuries in 2016, five years after the incident.[127][128] Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he\\'s a \"little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say. I have a friend who says the world doesn\\'t need another angry dwarf.\"[126]\\nIn January 2022, Dinklage appeared on an episode of the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, in which he criticized Disney\\'s portrayal of the Seven Dwarfs in the upcoming live-action remake of the 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. He stated that Disney tried to be progressive in one way by casting a Latina actress as Snow White, but retained the damaging stereotype of the Seven Dwarfs.[129][130] In response, Disney issued a statement, saying \"We are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community. We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period\".[131] Fellow dwarf actor and professional wrestler Hornswoggle criticized Dinklage for his comments, claiming he is trying to reduce the number of roles available that dwarf actors can play.[132]\\nAccording to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Dinklage\\'s most critically acclaimed films are Living in Oblivion (1995), The Station Agent (2003), Lassie (2005), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).\\nDinklage won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actor Guild Award for his performance in Game of Thrones.[68] He has also won four Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the same role.[67] He is also the only member of the cast to receive a Primetime Emmy. Dinklage has been nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor each year from 2013 to 2017.[133][134][135][136] He has also been nominated for Critics\\' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor three times, in 2012, 2016 and 2017.[137][138] As of 2018[update], Dinklage has won twelve awards from 58 nominations.

Developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s, the tank entered service in 1979 and replaced the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the West German army. Various iterations of the Leopard 2 continue to be operated by the armed forces of Germany, as well as 13 other European countries, and several non-European countries, including Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and Singapore. Some operating countries have licensed the Leopard 2 design for local production and domestic development.\\nThere are two main development tranches of the Leopard 2. The first encompasses tanks produced up to the Leopard 2A4 standard and are characterised by their vertically faced turret armour. The second tranche, from Leopard 2A5 onwards, has an angled, arrow-shaped, turret appliqué armour, together with other improvements. The main armament of all Leopard 2 tanks is a smoothbore 120\\xa0mm cannon made by Rheinmetall. This is operated with a digital fire control system, laser rangefinder, and advanced night vision and sighting equipment. The tank is powered by a V12 twin-turbo diesel engine made by MTU Friedrichshafen.\\nIn the 1990s, the Leopard 2 was used by the German Army on peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. In the 2000s, Dutch, Danish and Canadian forces deployed their Leopard 2 tanks in the War in Afghanistan as part of their contribution to the International Security Assistance Force. In the 2010s, Turkish Leopard 2 tanks saw action in Syria. In 2023, Ukrainian Leopard 2 tanks saw action in the Russo-Ukrainian War.[11]\\nEven as the Leopard 1 was just entering service, the West German military was interested in producing an improved tank in the next decade. This resulted in the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning in 1963.[12] However already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the German government issued the order to research future upgrade options for the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche in 1967.[13]\\nThis study was named vergoldeter Leopard (Gilded Leopard) and focused on incorporating advanced technology into the Leopard design. The projected upgrades added an autoloader, a coaxial autocannon and an independent commander\\'s periscope.[14] The anti-air machine gun could be operated from inside the vehicle and a TV surveillance camera was mounted on an extendable mast. The shape of the turret and hull was optimised using cast steel armour, while the suspension, transmission, and engine exhaust vents were improved.[15]\\nFollowing the end of the Gilded Leopard study in 1967, the West German government decided to focus on the Experimentalentwicklung (experimental development) in a feasibility study and to develop new components for upgrading the Leopard 1 and for use on a future main battle tank programme.[14] At first 25 million DM were invested, but after the industry came to the conclusion that with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested. The experimental development was contracted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but with the obligation to cooperate with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for the development of the turret.[16]\\nTwo prototypes with different components were built with the aim of improving the conception of Leopard 1 in such a way that it would match the firepower requirements of the MBT-70. A high first-hit probability at ranges of 2,000 metres (6,600\\xa0ft) and the ability to accurately engage targets on the move using a computerised fire control system were the main goals of the experimental development. The resulting vehicles were nicknamed Keiler (\"tusker\"). Two prototypes (ET 01 and ET 02) of the Keiler were built in 1969 and 1970, both of them being powered by the MB 872 engine.[16]\\nThe MBT-70 was a revolutionary design, but after large cost overruns and technological problems, Germany withdrew from the project in 1969. After unsuccessful attempts at saving the MBT-70 by conceptual changes in order to eliminate the biggest issue—the driver being seated in the turret—it became clear in late 1969 that Germany would stop the bi-national development.[15] The assistant secretary of the military procurement division of the German Ministry of Defence suggested reusing as many technologies developed for the MBT-70 as possible in a further programme, which was nicknamed Eber (\"boar\") due to his being named Eberhardt. The Eber used a modified MBT-70 turret and hull, with the driver being seated in the hull. Only a wooden mock-up was made.\\nOne year later, a choice was made to continue the development based on the earlier Keiler project of the late 1960s, instead of finishing the development of the Eber. In 1971, the name of the design was determined as Leopard 2 with the original Leopard retroactively becoming the Leopard 1, and Paul-Werner Krapke became the project officer of the Leopard 2 program.[17] Originally two versions were projected: the gun-armed Leopard 2K and the Leopard 2FK, which would be armed with the XM150 gun/launcher weapon of the MBT-70.[18]\\nIn 1971, 17 prototypes were ordered but only 16 hulls were built as the production of hull PT12 was cancelled. Ten were ordered initially before another seven were ordered. The 17 turrets were designated T1 to T17, and the hulls were designated PT1 to PT11 and PT13 to PT17. To test a larger number of components and concepts, each prototype was fitted with components not found on the other prototypes. Ten of the turrets were equipped with 105\\xa0mm smoothbore guns and the other seven prototypes were equipped with a 120\\xa0mm smoothbore gun.[18][19]\\nHulls PT11 and PT17 were fitted with a hydropneumatic suspension based on the MBT-70 design.[18] The running gears of these two hulls had only six road wheels. Different types of auxiliary power units (APUs) were mounted in the prototypes. All turrets were equipped with a machine gun for air defence, except the turret mounted on PT11, where a 20\\xa0mm remotely operated autocannon was mounted. With the exception of hulls PT07, PT09, PT15, and PT17, all prototypes used the MB 873 engine. The road wheels were taken from the MBT-70 and the return rollers from the Leopard 1.[18] The prototypes were designed with a projected weight of MLC50, which equals approximately 47.5 tonnes (46.7 long tons; 52.4 short tons). The welded turret utilised spaced armour formed by two steel plates.[20] The prototypes were equipped with an EMES-12 optical rangefinder and fire control system, which later was adopted on the Leopard 1A4.\\nIn mid-1973 a new turret was designed by Wegmann saving 1.5 tonnes (1.7 short tons) in weight.[21] It was nicknamed the Spitzmaus-Turm (shrew turret) due to the highly sloped front. This design was only possible with the new EMES-13 optical rangefinder, which required a base length of only 350 millimetres (14\\xa0in) instead of the previous 1,720 millimetres (68\\xa0in).[20] Based on experiences in the Yom Kippur War, a higher level of protection than the prototypes\\' heavily sloped spaced armour was demanded in late 1973 and the Spitzmaus-Turm was never produced.[22]\\nThe weight limit was increased from MLC50 to MLC60, which equals approximately 55 tonnes (54 long tons; 61 short tons). The T14 turret was modified to test a new armour configuration, taking on a blockier-looking appearance as a result of using vertical modules of spaced multilayer armour. It was also used to test the new EMES-13 optical rangefinder. The modified T14 turret was designated T14 mod.[22] and was fitted with a fully electric turret drive and stabilization system, which was developed jointly by General Electric and AEG Telefunken.\\nIn July 1973 German Federal Minister of Defence Georg Leber and his US counterpart James R. Schlesinger agreed upon a higher degree of standardisation in main battle tanks being favourable to NATO. By integrating components already fully developed by German companies for the Leopard 2, the costs of the XM1 Abrams, U.S. prototype tank developed after the MBT-70, could be reduced. A German commission was sent to the US to evaluate the harmonisation of components between the XM1 and Leopard 2.[23] However, under American law it was not possible for a public bidder to interfere in a procurement tender after a contract with intention of profits and deadline was awarded to private sector companies.[23]\\nAs a result, the modification of the Leopard 2 prototypes in order to meet the US Army requirements was investigated. Following a number of further talks, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on 11 December 1974 between Germany and the US, which declared that a modified version of the Leopard 2 should be trialed by the US against their XM1 prototypes,[24] after the Americans had bought and investigated prototype PT07 in 1973.[25] The MOU obliged the Federal Republic of Germany to send a complete prototype, a hull, a vehicle for ballistic tests and a number of special ballistic parts to the US, where they would be put through US testing procedures for no additional costs.[26]\\nThe Leopard 2AV (austere version) was based on the experiences of the previous Leopard 2 development. It was created in order to meet the US requirements and the latest protection requirements of the German MoD. The T14 mod turret was used as the base for the Leopard 2AV\\'s turret, but meeting the required level of protection for the hull required several attempts until the final ballistic trials on 23 to 26 June 1976.[27] Following the US\\' preference of laser rangefinders, the turret of prototype PT19 was fitted with a laser rangefinder developed together with the American company Hughes.[28]\\nIn comparison with the earlier Leopard 2 prototypes, the fire control system was simplified by replacing the EMES-12 optical rangefinder and removing the crosswind sensor, the air pressure and temperature sensors, the powder temperature sensor, the PERI R12 commander sight with IR searchlight, the short-range grenade launcher for use against infantry, the retractable searchlight, the spotlight, the retractable passive night vision sight, the APU and the mechanical loading assistant.[26]\\nDue to the design and production of the Leopard 2AV taking more time than expected, the shipment to the US and the US evaluation was delayed. It was not possible to test the Leopard 2AV before 1 September 1976.[27] Despite the German wish that the Leopard 2AV and the XM1 prototypes would be evaluated at the same time, the US Army decided not to wait for the Leopard 2AV and tested the XM1 prototypes from Chrysler and General Motors beforehand.[23][29]\\nTwo new prototype hulls and three turrets were shipped to the US: PT20 mounting a 105\\xa0mm rifled L7 gun and a Hughes fire control system, PT19 with the same fire control system but able to swap out the gun for the 120\\xa0mm Rheinmetall smoothbore gun, and the PT21 fitted with the Krupp Atlas Elektronik EMES-13 fire control system and the 120\\xa0mm Rheinmetall gun.[25] The Leopard 2AV fully met the US requirements.[30] A study made by the American FMC Corporation showed that it was possible to produce the Leopard 2AV under licence in America without exceeding the cost limits set by the US Army.[30] Before the trials were finished, it was decided that instead of the US Army possibly adopting the Leopard 2AV, the focus was shifted to the possibilities of common components between the two tanks. FMC, after having acquired the licenses for the production of the Leopard 2AV, decided not to submit a technical proposal, as they saw little to no chance for the US Army adopting a vehicle not developed in the US.[29]\\nThe US Army evaluation showed that on the XM1 a larger portion of the tank\\'s surface was covered by special armour (composite armour arrays) than on the Leopard 2AV.[29] Differences in armour protection were attributed to the different perceptions of the expected threats and the haste in which the Leopard 2AV was designed to accommodate special armour.[29] On mobility trials the Leopard 2AV performed equal to better than the XM1 prototypes. The AGT-1500 turbine engine proved to consume about 50% more fuel[31] and the Diehl tracks had a higher endurance, while the tracks used on the XM1 prototypes failed to meet the Army\\'s requirements.[30] The heat signature of the MTU diesel engine was much lower.[31] The fire control system and the sights of the Leopard 2 were considered to be better and the 120\\xa0mm gun proved to be superior.[29] The projected production costs for one XM1 tank were US$728,000 in 1976, and the costs for one Leopard 2AV were US$56,000 higher.[29]\\nAfter the American evaluation of the Leopard 2AV and the US Army\\'s decision to opt for the XM1 Abrams, both American and German sources blamed the other side. US Army test officials discovered that the PT19 Leopard 2AV prototype used for mobility trials did not contain special armor.[nb 1]\\nIn Germany, the test conditions were criticised for being unrealistic and favouring the XM1. Instead of using actual performance data, the calculated hypothetical acceleration was used.[31] The XM1 was found to have a slightly higher rate of fire despite having internal layouts similar to the Leopard 2AV because the XM1 prototypes were manned by professional crews, while the Leopard 2AV had to be manned by conscripts in order to prove that the Leopard 2AV was not too complicated.[31] Firing on the move was demonstrated on flat tracks, which nullified the better stabilization systems of the Leopard 2AV.[31]\\nGermany later withdrew its tank from consideration.[33]\\nThe decision to put the Leopard 2 tank in production for the German army was made after a study was undertaken[when?], which showed that adopting the Leopard 2 model would result in a greater combat potential of the German army than producing more Leopard 1A4 tanks or developing an improved version of the Leopard 1A4 with 105/120\\xa0mm smoothbore gun, improved armour protection, a new fire control system and a 890 kilowatts (1,190\\xa0hp) or 1,100 kilowatts (1,500\\xa0hp) engine.[34] Various changes were applied to the Leopard 2 design before the series production started in 1979.[35][36] The engine, transmission, and suspension were slightly modified and improved. The ballistic protection of the turret and hull was improved and weak spots were eliminated.[37]\\nThe turret bustle containing the ready ammunition racks and the hydraulic system was separated from the crew compartment and fitted with blowout panels. The development of several new components was introduced to the Leopard 2 during the Leopard 2AV development and after the US testing was completed. For the series version, the Hughes-designed laser rangefinder made with US Common Modules was chosen over the passive EMES-13 rangefinder. The EMES-13 system was considered to be the superior solution, but the Hughes system was cheaper and fully developed.[37]\\nThe German company Krupp-Atlas-Elektronik acquired the licence of the Hughes design and modified it to meet the needs of the German army.[37] The modified rangefinder received the designation EMES-15. The installation of the US AGT-1500 turbine engine in the Leopard 2 was tested by MaK.[30] The AGT-1500 was from the United States and required deep modifications to the Leopard 2\\'s chassis. However, driving tests at the WTD 41 revealed a number of drawbacks such as high fuel consumption and the poor performance of the transmission including the brakes.[30] This project was thus terminated.\\nIn January 1977 Germany ordered a small pre-series of three hulls and two turrets which were delivered in 1978. These vehicles had increased armour protection on the front of the hull. One of the hulls was fitted with the earlier T21 turret and was used by the German army school in Munster for troop trials until 1979.[38] In September 1977, 1800 Leopard 2 tanks were ordered, to be produced in five batches. The main contractor was Krauss-Maffei, but Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) was awarded a contract for producing 45% of the tanks. The first batch consisted of 380 tanks. The delivery of six tanks was scheduled for 1979, 114 for 1980, 180 for 1981, and 300 tanks each following year.[39]\\nThe first series-production tank was delivered on 25 October 1979. By 1982, all of the first batch of 380 Leopard 2 tanks had been completed. 209 were built by Krauss-Maffei (chassis no. 10001 to 10210) and 171 by MaK (chassis no. 20001 to 20172). The first production tanks were fitted with the PzB-200 image intensifier due to production shortages of the new thermal night-sight system, which was later retrofitted to the earlier models. After the original five batches, three further batches of Leopard 2 tanks were ordered, increasing the number of Leopard 2 tanks ordered by Germany to a total of 2125.[40] The sixth batch was ordered in June 1987 and consisted of 150 tanks, which were produced between January 1988 and May 1989. The seventh batch of 100 tanks was produced between May 1988 and April 1990. The last batch for the German army totalling 75 tanks was produced from January 1991 to March 1992.[40]\\nDuring its production run during the Cold War, 16 Leopard 2 tanks were being produced per month. The vehicles were produced at a slower rate in the following decades, however KMW still retained the capacity to return to such manufacturing levels should they need to be made again at a higher rate and supply chains are able to deliver sufficient materials.[41]\\nWhile previous models only varied in detail, the Leopard 2A4 introduced a digital ballistic computer and an improved fire extinguishing system. Starting with the sixth batch, tanks were fitted with an improved armour array and new side skirts. In 1984 the German military procurement agency stated a number of requirements for a future Leopard 2 upgrade. In 1989, the Kampfwertsteigerung (combat potential improvement) programme was initiated in Germany with the delivery of first prototypes. The official military requirements were published in March 1990.[42]\\nThe KWS programme was projected to consist of three stages. The first stage replaced the Rheinmetall 120\\xa0mm L/44 gun barrel and the corresponding gun mount with a longer barrelled and more lethal L/55 version.[42] This stage was adopted in the form of 225 Leopard 2A6 tanks, starting in 2001 and lasting until 2005.[43] Stage 2 focused on improvements of armour protection and survivability: it was adopted in the form of the Leopard 2A5, starting in 1995. The base armour of the tank was exchanged and additional armour modules were installed at the turret. The first batch of 225 Leopard 2 tanks was upgraded to Leopard 2A5 configuration between 1995 and 1998; a second batch of 125 followed from 1999 to 2002.[44]\\nThe third stage was the planned replacement of the Leopard 2 turret by a new turret fitted with a 140\\xa0mm NPzK tank gun, an autoloader, and the IFIS battlefield management system.[42] The ballistic protection at the hull was to be improved.[42] Originally a total requirement for 650 Leopard 2 tanks with KWS 3 was projected.[43] It was never finalised, but the 140\\xa0mm NPzK tank gun was tested on an older prototype. In 1995 it was decided to cancel due to changes in the political environment. The funds were redirected to the Neue Gepanzerte Plattformen (New Armoured Platforms) project of the German army. The Leopard 2A6M was developed with a kit providing enhanced protection against mines that can detonate below the hull (like mines with bending wire triggers) and explosively formed penetrator mines.[43] The weight of the Leopard 2A6M is 62.5 tonnes.[45]\\nThe latest version of the tank is the Leopard 2A7, which entered service in an initial batch of 20 tanks in 2014.[46] Already before the first Leopard 2A7 tank was handed over to the German Army, plans for upgrades were made.[47] At this time an \"extensive\" increase in combat value, while retaining the original mobility of the Leopard 2, was planned.[47] The optics of the tank will also be improved.[47]\\nIn April 2015, Welt am Sonntag claimed that tungsten (wolfram) rounds used in Leopard 2 cannot penetrate the Russian T-90 or the modernized version of the T-80. They also stated that the German military will develop a new improved round, but it will be exclusively developed for the Leopard 2A7.[48]\\nIn 2015 Rheinmetall disclosed that it was developing a new 130\\xa0mm smoothbore gun for the Leopard 2 tank and its successor.[citation needed] This gun will offer a 50% increase in performance and penetration.[49] Marketing for the new gun was slated to begin in 2016.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2 first entered service in 1979, and its service life is anticipated to end around 2030. In May 2015, the German Ministry of Defence announced plans to develop a tank jointly with France as a successor to both the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks.  Technologies and concepts will be investigated to determine what capabilities are needed in a future tank.[50] Deployment of the new tank, titled Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), will be preceded by incremental upgrades to the Leopard 2, including a new digital turret core system and situational awareness system and an active protection system (APS).[51]\\nA short-term lethality increase will come from a higher pressure 120\\xa0mm gun firing new ammunition, expected to deliver 20 percent better performance than the L/55.  Mid-term efforts will focus on a Rheinmetall 130\\xa0mm cannon concept offering 50 percent better armour penetration.  With the Russian T-14 Armata being equipped with the Afghanit, an active protection system designed to mitigate the effectiveness of ATGM, more importance is being placed on direct-fire weapons.[51]\\nThe Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design.[52] The armour consists of a combination of steel plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials.[53][54][55] Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used. The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets.[56] The Leopard 2\\'s armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970.[57]\\nLater, in the mid-1970s, full details about Burlington were handed over to the West German government. The frontal arc of the Leopard 2\\'s armour is designed to withstand large caliber kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge projectiles.[55] During the 1980s, it was estimated that the Leopard 2\\'s front would resist 125\\xa0mm armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds fired from a distance of 1,500\\xa0m.[56][58]\\nThe Leopard 2A4\\'s armour has a maximum physical thickness of 800 millimetres (31\\xa0in) based on unofficial measurements and estimates made by former conscripts and professional soldiers of the German army.[59] On the Leopard 2A5 and subsequent models, the thickness is increased by the wedge-shaped armour module to 1,500 millimetres (59\\xa0in).[59]\\nThe side and the rear of the tank protect against heavy machine guns, medium caliber rounds, and older types of tank ammunition. The side of the hull is covered by armour skirts to increase protection against projectiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The frontal third of the hull sides is covered by heavy ballistic skirts, while the rest of the hull sides is covered by steel-reinforced rubber skirts. For increased protection against mines, the sides of the hull floor are sloped by 45° and the floor is reinforced with corrugations.[53]\\nThe Leopard 2\\'s design follows the concept of compartmentation. Possible sources of fire or explosions have been moved away from the crew.[55] In the turret, the ammunition and the hydraulics are located in compartments separated from the crew. In case of a detonation, the blow-off panels on the compartment roofs will direct the explosion and fire away from the crew. The crew is also protected against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) threats, as the Leopard 2 is equipped with a Dräger NBC overpressurization system, which provides up to 4 hPA over-pressure inside the vehicle.[60]\\nTwo groups of four Wegmann 76\\xa0mm smoke mortars are mounted on either side of the turret and can be electrically fired either as single rounds or in salvos of four. They are mounted on most Leopard 2 models, with the exception of Dutch Leopard 2s, which are equipped instead with a Dutch-designed smoke mortar system with six barrels on each side.[60] Swedish Stridsvagn 122 utilises French GALIX smoke dispensers, similar to the system found on the French Leclerc.[61]\\nThe Leopard 2 is equipped with a fire protection system. Four 9\\xa0kg halon fire extinguisher bottles are installed on the right behind the driver\\'s station. The bottles are connected to pipes and hoses and are activated automatically by the fire detection system when temperatures rise above 82\\xa0°C (180\\xa0°F) inside the fighting compartment, or manually via a control panel in the driver\\'s compartment.[60] An extra 2.5\\xa0kg halon fire extinguisher is stored on the floor beneath the main gun.\\nFollowing Leopard 2\\'s introduction into service in 1979, the armour has been gradually improved over the years. A modified version of spaced multilayer armour was introduced beginning with the 97th vehicle of the 6th production batch.[62] The same batch also introduced an improved type of heavy ballistic skirts.\\nThe Leopard 2A5 upgrade focused on increased armour protection. While upgrading a Leopard 2 tank to the Leopard 2A5 configuration, the roof covering the armour modules is cut open and new armour modules are inserted.[63][64] New additional armour modules made of laminated armour cover the frontal arc of the turret. They have a distinctive arrowhead shape and improve protection against both kinetic penetrators and shaped charges.[64][65] The side skirts also incorporate improved armour protection.[65] A 25\\xa0mm-thick spall liner reduces the danger of crew injuries in case of armour penetration.[60][64]\\nThe Leopard 2A7 features the latest generation of passive armour and belly armour providing protection against mines and IEDs.[66] The Leopard 2A7 is fitted with adapters for mounting additional armour modules or protection systems against RPGs.[67]\\nFor urban combat, the Leopard 2 can be fitted with different packages of modular armour. The Leopard 2A4M CAN, Leopard 2 PSO (Peace Support Operations) and the Leopard 2A7 can mount thick modules of composite armour along the flanks of the turret and hull, while slat armour can be adapted at the vehicle\\'s rear. The armour modules provide protection against the RPG-7, which depending on the warhead can penetrate between 280 millimetres (11\\xa0in) and 600 millimetres (24\\xa0in) of steel armour.[68] The Leopard 2A6M CAN increases protection against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) by including additional slat armour.[69]\\nAdditional armour packages have been developed by a number of different companies. IBD Deisenroth has developed upgrades with MEXAS and Advanced Modular Armor Protection (AMAP) composite armour, the latter is being used on Singaporean and Indonesian Leopard 2 tanks. RUAG has developed an armour upgrade utilizing their SidePRO-ATR composite armour. This upgrade was first presented on the IAV 2013.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2A4M and 2A6M add an additional mine protection plate for the belly, which increases protection against mines and IEDs.[60]\\nOn 22 February 2021, the German Defence Ministry agreed to acquire Trophy, an active protection system of Israeli design. 17 German Army tanks will be fitted with the system, with integration planned to be completed in 2023.[70]\\nEstimated levels of protection for the Leopard 2 range from 590 to 690\\xa0mm RHAe on the turret, 600\\xa0mm RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A4, to 920–940\\xa0mm RHAe on the turret, 620\\xa0mm RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A6 against kinetic projectiles.[60][unreliable source?]\\nAccording to a description page hosted by the Federation of American Scientists, the armour of the Leopard 2A4 is believed to provide protection equivalent to 700\\xa0mm armour steel (RHA) against kinetic energy penetrators and 1000\\xa0mm RHA against shaped charge warheads.[71]\\nThe primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120\\xa0mm smoothbore gun—the same gun later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models).[60] Ammunition for the gun comprises 27 rounds stored in a special magazine in the forward section of the hull, to the left of the driver\\'s station, with an additional 15 rounds stored in the left side of the turret bustle, which is separated from the fighting compartment by an electrically operated door.[60]\\nIf the ammunition storage area is hit, a blow-off panel in the turret roof would direct an explosion upwards away from the crew compartment.[60] The gun is fully stabilised, and can fire a variety of types of rounds, such as the German DM43 APFSDS-T anti-tank round, which is said to be able to penetrate 560 millimeters (22\\xa0in)[72] of steel armour at a range of 2,000 metres (2,200\\xa0yd),[73] and the German DM12 high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT).[74]\\nFor the L/55 gun, a newer APFSDS-T round was introduced to take advantage of the longer barrel, the DM-53, which is said to be able to penetrate 750\\xa0mm of RHAe armour at a range of 2,000\\xa0meters.[60] The bore evacuator and the gun\\'s thermal sleeve of the A4 and A5, designed to regulate the temperature of the barrel, are fabricated from glass-reinforced plastic. The barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life.[75] The main gun is capable of power elevating from +20° to −9°.[76]\\nRheinmetall has developed an upgrade for Leopard 2 tanks to give them the ability to fire the Israeli LAHAT anti-tank guided missile through the main gun. The missile can engage targets out to a range of 6,000 metres (20,000\\xa0ft).[77]\\nThe Leopard 2 is equipped with two machine guns, one mounted co-axially, the other on an anti-aircraft mount. German models use the MG\\xa03 7.62\\xa0mm machine gun; Dutch and Singaporean models use FN MAG 7.62\\xa0mm machine guns; Swiss models use Swiss MG 87 7.5\\xa0mm machine guns.[60] 4,750 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried on board the Leopard 2. More recent variants such as the Leopard 2A7+ are capable of mounting a Remotely-Controlled Weapons Station fitted with a Browning M2HB Heavy Machine Gun, near the commander\\'s hatch.\\nThe standard fire control system found on the Leopard 2 is the German EMES 15 fire control system with a dual magnification stabilised primary sight. The primary sight has an integrated neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet Nd:YAG laser rangefinder and a 120 element mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe (also known as CMT) Zeiss thermographic camera, both of which are linked to the tank\\'s fire control computer.[78] A backup 8x auxiliary telescope FERO-Z18 is mounted coaxially for the gunner.[60]\\nThe commander has an independent periscope, the Rheinmetall/Zeiss PERI R17 A2. This is a stabilised panoramic periscope sight designed for day/night observation and target identification. It provides an all round view with a traverse of 360°. The thermal image from the commander\\'s periscope is displayed on a monitor inside the tank. Initial production tanks were not equipped with a thermal sight, due to the sight not being ready, and instead temporarily substituted the PZB 200 low light TV system (LLLTV).[60]\\nThe fire control suite is capable of providing up to three range values in four seconds. The range data is transmitted to the fire control computer and is used to calculate the firing solution. Because the laser rangefinder is integrated into the gunner\\'s primary sight, the gunner is able to read the digital range measurement directly. The maximum range of the laser rangefinder is up to 10,000\\xa0m with a measuring accuracy within 10\\xa0m at this range.[78] The combined system allows the Leopard 2 to engage moving targets at ranges of up to 5,000\\xa0meters whilst itself being on the move over rough terrain.\\nThe Leopard 2 is propelled by the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine. It provides 1,500\\xa0PS (1.1\\xa0MW) at 2600 RPM and 4,700\\xa0N⋅m (3,500\\xa0lb⋅ft) of torque at 1600–1700 RPM. The MTU MB 873 Ka-501 is a four-stroke, 47.7 litre, 90° V-block 12-cylinder, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, liquid-cooled diesel engine (with multi-fuel capability). It has an estimated fuel consumption rate of around 300 litres per 100\\xa0km on roads and 500 litres per 100\\xa0km across the country, and is coupled to the Renk HSWL 354 gear and brake system.[60][78]\\nThe Renk HSWL 354 transmission has four forward and two reverse gears, with a torque converter and is completely automatic, with the driver selecting the range.[60] The Leopard 2 has four fuel tanks, which have a total capacity of approximately 1,160 litres, giving a maximum road range of about 500\\xa0km.[60] The propulsion pack is capable of driving the tank to a top road speed of 68\\xa0km/h (limited to 50\\xa0km/h during peacetime by law), and a top reverse speed of 31\\xa0km/h.[79] The power pack can be changed in the field in 35\\xa0minutes.[60] The engine and transmission are separated from the crew compartment through a fireproof bulkhead.[78] An enhanced version of the EuroPowerPack, with a 1,650\\xa0PS (1.2\\xa0MW) MTU MT883 engine has been trialled by the Leopard 2.[78]\\nThe Leopard 2 has a torsion bar suspension and has advanced friction dampers. The running gear consists of seven dual rubber-tired road wheels and four return rollers per side, with the idler wheel at the front and drive sprocket at the rear.[60] The tracks are Diehl 570F tracks, with rubber-bushed end connectors, which have removable rubber pads and use 82 links on each track. For use in icy ground, up to 18 rubber pads can be replaced by the same number of grousers, which are stored in the vehicle\\'s bow when not in use.[60] The upper part of the tracks are covered with side skirts.[76]\\nThe Leopard 2 can drive through water 4 meters (13\\xa0ft) deep using a snorkel or 1.2 meters (3\\xa0ft 11\\xa0in) without any preparation. It can climb vertical obstacles over one metre high.\\nThe German Army has prioritised mobility in the Leopard 2, which has made it one of the fastest MBTs in the world.[80]\\nUkrainian forces have said that the Leopard 2 tank is only slightly louder than a diesel van. This lack of noise, they claim, gives them a tactical advantage during an ambush. One Ukrainian commander estimated that Russian forces only heard the Leopard 2 from 200 metres, during an ambush. Compared to 2-3 kilometres for their older Soviet era tanks.[81]\\nGermany has fielded about 2,125 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in various versions, but many were sold following German reunification. The Leopard 2 became very popular in the 1990s, when the shrinking German army offered many of its redundant Leopard 2s at a reduced price. It became successful enough in Europe that the manufacturer started calling it the Euro Leopard, despite France, Britain, and Italy all operating their own MBTs. With further non-European orders, the name \"Global-Leopard\" is now used instead.[82] Leopard 2 tanks have also been resold by original export customers, although reexport has always been conditional on consent from the German government who control the platform\\'s export licence. Other countries have bought newly manufactured vehicles or have produced them locally under licence.\\nThe Netherlands ordered 445 Leopard 2 tanks on 2 March 1979, after examining the results of the Leopard 2AV in the United States.[83] It became the first export customer of the Leopard 2 and the vehicles were delivered between July 1981 and July 1986. Dutch Leopard 2 tanks have been subsequently exported to Austria, Canada, Norway, and Portugal. Leopard 2 tanks remaining in Dutch service have been upgraded to 2A5 and 2A6 standards.\\nThe Swiss Army decided to purchase Leopard 2 tanks over the M1A1 Abrams after trialling both tanks between August 1981 and June 1982. The Swiss decision was made in August 1983 and the funding was approved by the government in 1984.[84] Thirty-five of the tanks were delivered by Kraus-Maffei by June 1987. Eidgenössische Konstruktionswerkstätte Thun started license production of 345 additional vehicles in December 1987.\\nAfter investigating the option of a locally developed replacement for the Strv 103 tank, Sweden decided to buy a foreign tank model. The Leopard 2 Improved (Leopard 2A5 prototype) won the competition against the M1A2 Abrams and the French Leclerc. The Swedish military also evaluated the Soviet T-80U tank, but separately from the other tanks. After intensive tests from January to June 1994, the Swedish military opted for the Leopard 2.[85]  The Swedish military found that the Leopard 2 Improved met their military demands by 90%.[85] The M1A2 met the Swedish requirements by 86%, whereas the Leclerc met 63%. In June 1994 Sweden ordered the production of 120 modified Leopard 2A5, to be known as Stridsvagn 122 (Strv 122) in Swedish service. Strv 122 features Swedish-developed appliqué armour, a new command system, and improved electronics.[86] Of the 120 Strv 122, 29 were manufactured in Germany by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann while the other 91 were manufactured by the Swedish firms Bofors and Hägglunds.[87] The first Stridsvagn 122 was delivered in December 1996. These remain in Swedish service and have received periodic upgrades.\\nSweden also leased and later bought a total of 160 Leopard 2A4 tanks in 1994 and 1995, known in Swedish service as Stridsvagn 121 (Strv 121). The first Strv 121 was delivered in February 1994.[85] The Strv 121 fleet was mothballed by 2006.[88] Sweden has retained a number of Strv 121 tanks as training aids; 6 Strv 121 have since been converted into AEV 3 Kodiak armoured engineering vehicles, and a further 6 have been converted into Leguan armoured bridgelayers.[89][90]\\nDenmark bought 51 ex-German Leopard 2A4 tanks after the Danish military school, the Hærens Kampskole, recommended basing the adoption of a new tank on the Swedish army trials. The first tanks were delivered in 1998, but the upgrade to Leopard 2A5 level was already decided the next year.[91] In 2004-2006 the Danish army bought another six ex-German Leopard 2 tanks.[92]\\nIn 1998, Greece held a competition to determine the main battle tank for the Hellenic Army. The Leopard 2 Improved managed to outperform the Challenger 2E, Leclerc, M1A2 Abrams, T-80U, and T-84 and was chosen by the Greek officials. In March 2003 Greece ordered 170 Leopard 2 tanks, of which 140 were locally assembled.[93][94] Greece also bought 183 Leopard 2A4 and 150 Leopard 1 tanks.[95]\\nSpain initially leased 109 Leopard 2A4 tanks, after Krauss-Maffei withdrew from the Lince development, a special lighter version of the Leopard 2 developed together with Santa Bárbara Sistemas. Before the end of the Lince tank, Spain had already rejected the M1A1 Abrams and the Vickers Valiant. After deciding to purchase the leased tanks, Santa Bárbara Sistemas acquired the licence to locally produce 219 Leopard 2A6 tanks for the Spanish army.[96]\\nPoland received 128 Leopard 2A4 tanks from German army stocks in 2002. In 2013 Poland ordered a further 119 ex-German Leopard 2s. Finland bought 124 used Leopard 2A4 tanks and six armoured bridge-layer Leopard 2L tanks from Germany in 2002 and 2003. The tanks served as replacements for the old Soviet-made T-55 and T-72M1. The Netherlands resold 114 of their tanks (and one turret) to Austria, 80 to Canada in 2007,[97] 52 to Norway, 37 to Portugal and 100 to Finland.\\nIn December 2018, Hungary placed an order for 44 Leopard 2A7+s and 12 secondhand 2A4s. The order coincided with the procurement of 24 Panzerhaubitze 2000, and was expected to replace Hungary\\'s current fleet of T-72 tanks \"no sooner than 2020\".[98][99]\\nIn February 2023, the Norwegian Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, announced that Norway would be ordering 54 new Leopard 2A7 tanks at a cost of NKr\\xa019.7 billion with a further option for 18 vehicles to be delivered at a later date. The first Leopard 2A7s are due to be delivered by 2026, and operational by 2031. The Norwegian government had been weighing up either the Leopard 2A7 or the South Korean K2 Black Panther as a replacement for its aging Leopard 2A4 fleet.[100][101] The tanks will be designated Leopard 2A8 NOR.[102]\\nIn 2005, Turkey ordered 298 Leopard 2 tanks from German army stocks.[103] The Leopard 2 was chosen in 2001 after successfully competing one year earlier in the Turkish army trials against the T-84 Yatagan, Leclerc and a version of the M1A2 Abrams fitted with a German MTU diesel engine. Turkey wanted to buy 1,000 Leopard 2 tanks in 1999, but the German government rejected the deal.\\nSingapore bought 96 Leopard 2 tanks from Germany in 2006.[104] Chile bought 172 ex-German Leopard 2A4 tanks and 273 Marder 1A3 IFVs in 2007.\\nIndonesia ordered 103 Leopard 2 tanks and 42 Marder 1A3 IFVs in 2013.[105] At first the export of heavy weapons to Indonesia was not allowed by the German government, due to the questionable human rights record of Indonesia. 61 of the 103 Leopard 2 tanks will be upgraded by Rheinmetall to the Leopard 2RI standard, based on Rheinmetall\\'s Revolution modular upgrade concept.[106]\\nQatar ordered 62 Leopard 2A7 tanks and 24 Panzerhaubitze 2000s in 2013.[107] The delivery of the tanks started in late 2015 and the first tanks were displayed on a military parade in December 2015.[108]\\nOn 2 July 2023 Ukraine had reportedly received 54 Leopard 2A4 from NATO-member countries.[109]\\nSince April 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian government has requested that their allies donate Western-made main battle tanks. Poland, Finland and others have all announced a willingness to contribute Leopard 2 tanks from their stocks, with around 100 tanks from various states ready to be transferred to Ukraine.[110] However, when Germany exported the tanks to these countries, it had made reexport conditional on a German government permit, as based on the Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz and Außenwirtschaftsgesetz. Until 22 January 2023, it was unclear whether such a consent would be provided with Germany determined to avoid any perception of escalating the conflict, and wary of being labelled an aggressor.[111] Germany has also been keen to extract an American commitment to provide its own M1 Abrams tanks, before sending German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.[112]\\nThe matter was discussed at a conference of defence ministers from NATO members and allies, but no agreement was reached.[113][114] The German position was heavily criticized by some of the other European governments with Poland threatening to unilaterally export their Leopards if permission from Berlin was not given.[115] The Polish and Ukrainian governments then announced that Ukrainian soldiers would start training on Polish Leopard 2 tanks in Poland.[116]\\nOn 22 January 2023, the German minister for foreign affairs, Annalena Baerbock, told French media that Germany \"would not stand in the way\" of any Polish decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine but noted that \"for the moment the question has not been asked.\"[117] Two days later, Poland made an official request for permission to transfer Polish Leopards to Ukraine.[118]\\nOn 24 January Der Spiegel reported that the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would the following day, officially announce the transfer of an undisclosed number of German Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, beginning with 14 Leopard 2A6s from the active Bundeswehr inventory.[119] The German government would also give permission to any country seeking to reexport Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.[120] These reports were formally confirmed by the German government on 25 January.[121]\\nIt was also reported that Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, was encouraging Leopard-operating states to start training Ukrainian personnel in their use.[111]\\nThe German decision to provide and approve the provision of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine came after U.S. President Joe Biden decided to provide Ukraine with M1 Abrams tanks, as Germany insisted on moving in coordination with its allies. The decision to provide M1 Abrams tanks had previously been opposed by the Pentagon.[122]\\nOn 15 February 2023, Pistorius expressed his frustration at Germany\\'s allies in their announcement of any donations of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, saying it had \"not been exactly breathtaking, to put it mildly.\" Since the change in German position on exports, only Poland had matched the German promise to provide 14 tanks - the two largest donations from a single country.[123]\\nOn 25 January 2023, the German government confirmed that it would make 14 Leopard 2A6 (a company-strength number) available for Ukraine and would give authorisation to European partners to reexport their vehicles.[121] The goal is for European Leopard 2 operators to provide two battalions worth, or 88 tanks, to Ukraine.[124]\\nAccording to the German government, the tanks will be delivered to Ukraine after training Ukrainian service personnel. This process would take up to three months. Some tanks are held by the Bundeswehr, others by the Leopard manufacturer Rheinmetall. The latter has said they could be ready to be dispatched by March 2023. However, they also warned that some vehicles held in long-term storage would require extensive refurbishment and updating before they could be considered suitable for combat in Ukraine.[120][111] On 26 January, Pistorius, the German minister of defense, stated that the tanks would be delivered in late March or early April.[125] On 24 February 2023, the German Department of Defence confirmed Germany would increase its Leopard 2A6 contribution from 14 to 18, thus providing 1 full tank battalion together with the contributions of Portugal and Sweden.[126]\\nOn 27 March 2023, Germany delivered 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine with two accompanying armoured recovery vehicles and necessary spare parts.[127]\\nOn 28 March 2023, the security board of the Swiss National Council recommended that 25 Leopard 2 in storage should be sold to the German manufacturer Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann so that Germany can replace some of its own tanks now serving in Ukraine. As of this day, Switzerland keeps 96 Leopard 2 in storage. As the tanks\\' sale requires decommissioning, the Bundeswehr waits for approval by the Swiss parliament.[128]\\nOn 27 September 2023, the Swiss parliament has voted to decommission 25 Leopard 2 tanks, allowing them to be sold back to Germany. Germany has given assurances that ex-Swiss tanks will not be sent to Ukraine.[129]\\nPoland welcomed the German decision to allow the transfer of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, with the Polish government announcing on 25 January it would transfer 14 Leopards to Ukraine from a total Polish stock of 247, in addition to a further 50–60 Soviet-era tanks.[130] On 24 February 2023, the first 4 Leopard 2A4 tanks from Polish stocks were delivered to Ukraine. These are the first Leopard 2 tanks to be operated by Ukraine.[131]\\nOn 26 January 2023, the Canadian Defence Minister, Anita Anand, announced that Canada would be sending four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, with the potential for more to follow. These vehicles were reportedly \\'combat ready.\\' Canada will also provide appropriate training to Ukrainian forces who will go on to operate these tanks.[132] The first Canadian Leopard 2 tanks had arrived in Poland on 5 February, to allow Ukrainian troops to begin training.[133] On 24 February, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, announced that Canada would be sending a further four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine along with 1 armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) and 5,000 rounds of ammunition.[134]\\nOn 20 January 2023 the Czech Defense Ministry issued a statement that the media reports indicating the Czech Republic and Slovakia were willing to give up their Leopard 2 tanks for Ukraine were false, and that rumors that the Czech Republic would receive American Abrams tanks in exchange for Leopards were also false.[135] As of December 2022, both countries had only received 1 Leopard 2A4 each from Rheinmetall as part of Germany\\'s Ringtaush program in exchange for them delivering older Soviet equipment to Ukraine, while the remaining Leopard 2A4s are still being refurbished (expected to be delivered throughout 2023).[136]\\nWhile it was reported in the international press that Denmark had signalled that it could contribute a number of tanks,[137] there was no official indication from the Danish Government that any Danish Leopard 2s would be sent to Ukraine. Of the Danish inventory of 44 tanks, 14 were deployed to Estonia as part of NATO EFP, with a further number receiving upgrades at the German manufacturers.[138] Some Danish opposition politicians voiced support for a transfer of Danish tanks.[139] Unlike those considered by other countries, the Danish Leopards are of the new 2A7 standard, which would represent some logistic and mechanical challenges compared to the other variants.[140] Denmark instead announced on 7 February that it was jointly purchasing 100-178 Leopard 1A5 tanks with Germany and the Netherlands.[141] Denmark also announced on 20 April 2023 that they would jointly finance with the Netherlands the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks.[142]\\nFinland had suggested before the German decision on reexport, that it could supply Ukraine with a limited number of Leopard 2 tanks. The Finnish President, Sauli Niinistö, warned that \"the number of tanks [to be sent to Ukraine] cannot be large, since Finland borders on Russia and is not part of NATO.\"[143] On 23 February Finland announced it will give 3 Leopard 2R mine clearing vehicles to Ukraine. Finnish total stock of this type will return the same (6) with planned purchase of 3 replacement vehicles from Germany.[144]\\nOn 25 January 2023 it was reported that Greece was one of the countries that had indicated it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.[145] On 29 January 2023 it was erroneously reported that approximately 14 Leopard 2 tanks would be provided, though it was unclear if it would be the 2A4 or 2A6 HEL variant.[146] However, on 31 January, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis clarified that Greece would not supply any Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing \"they are absolutely necessary for our defense posture.\"[147] Leaked Pentagon documents revealed that Greece was preparing to donate 5 of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, though Greek defense minister Nikolaos Panayiotopoulos reiterated later in April his government\\'s opposition to tank deliveries to Ukraine, making confirmation of the delivery uncertain.[148]\\nThe Netherlands was considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte suggesting that the Dutch government could purchase tanks from other countries and donate them.[149] There were also some discussions about Netherlands purchasing the 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks they lease from Germany. No refusal was made from Germany to sell them as no formal request to buy them was made; both countries agreed that they were critical to the operations of the joint German-Dutch military unit. However, the Netherlands agreed to supply ammunition for Leopard tanks and announced it had not abandoned its intention to contribute to the tank initiative, while also noting it was helping to purchase Leopard 1A5 tanks with Denmark and Germany.[150] The Netherlands later announced it was jointly financing with Denmark the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks, with delivery expected in early 2024.[151]\\nOn 25 January 2023, Norway pledged to donate spare Leopards to Ukraine with reports speculating that between four and eight of its 36 Leopard 2A4 tanks would be sent.[137][152][153] Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said in an interview with Norwegian public television NRK: \"Norway and the government support the donation of battle tanks to Ukraine. Norway will take part,\" but did not specify how many would be sent.[154] On 14 February 2023, Gram announced that 8 Norwegian Leopard 2 tanks and 4 Leopard 1 derived \"special purpose vehicles\" would be handed over to Ukraine. The special purpose vehicles turned out to be a mix of 3 NM189 AEVs and 1 NM217 ARV.[155][156] In February 2023, Norway ordered 54 Leopard 2A7 tanks (later changed to 2A8 variant) to be delivered from 2026, with a further option for 18 vehicles if necessary.\\nWhen the German government changed its position on the reexport of Leopard 2 tanks, it was reported that the Portuguese government was preparing to send four of their Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine.[157] On 4 February, Prime Minister António Costa confirmed that Portugal would send Leopards to Ukraine, but did not confirm the number of vehicles set to be delivered. It is understood that Portugal is working with Germany to obtain the necessary parts to repair inoperable tanks in its inventory of 37 Leopard 2 tanks, but it has been widely reported by local media that most are inoperable. Costa expressed hopes that Portuguese tanks would be delivered by March 2023.[158] On 14 February, it was reported that Portugal had earmarked 3 Leopard 2A6 tanks for donation to Ukraine.[123] All 3 were confirmed donated on March 27 together with the 18 German Leopard 2A6.[159]\\nOn 25 January 2023, Slovakia announced it was not considering the transfer of any of its Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, but were willing to provide T-72 tanks if other allies replaced them with other tanks. The reason cited for this was that Slovakia had only received 1 of the 15 Leopard tanks it was promised as part of Germany\\'s Ringtaush program, which it was getting in exchange for supplying Ukraine with 30 Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicles.[160]\\nOn 4 June 2022 it was reported that Spain was considering providing 40 of its 53 retired Leopard 2A4 tanks stored in Zaragoza.[161] On 8 June German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied receiving any formal request from Spain for an export permit for Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.[162] However it was later confirmed on 10 June by the Spanish defense minister they were considering the transfer.[163] On 12 June, anonymous government sources told Der Spiegel that the Scholz government blocked any transfer of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing this \"would constitute a departure\" from an informal NATO decision not to provide Western tanks at that time.[164] By 2 August, Spain officially backtracked on its decision, arguing the tanks at Zaragoza were in \"deplorable condition\" and that it could not send any.[165]\\nThe Spanish government was later reported to be considering to send an unconfirmed number of Spanish Leopard 2E tanks to Ukraine in January 2023 following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.[166] On 14 February the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles confirmed Spain was providing training to 55 Ukrainian tank crew members and technicians on the Leopard 2.[167] On 22 February, Robles also confirmed that Spain was in the process of preparing six Leopard 2A4 tanks for delivery to Ukraine by late March or early April.[168] On 5 February 2023, it was reported that at least 11 of the 53 tanks stored at Zaragoza had been drawn out of storage to be refurbished and upgraded to have \"the same lethality\" as modern versions of the Leopard 2 before being sent to Ukraine. Five were sent to the Santa Bárbara Sistemas plant in Alcalá de Guadaira and six had already been moved to Seville for diagnostics and repairs. The Ministry of Defence had not published the contracts for the retrofits out of secrecy. It was unclear however if ammunition would be supplied with the tanks as Spain only has 9 rounds for each of its Leopard 2E tanks.[169] On 23 February Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez confirmed during a visit to Kyiv that Spain was sending at least 10 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.[170]\\nSweden began considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks in January 2023 and did not rule out contributing its Strv 122 at a later stage.[171] On 24 February, the Swedish minister of defence Pål Jonson announced that Sweden would be providing 10 Leopard 2A5 tanks to Ukraine.[172]\\nStarting on 12 June 1999, 28 Leopard 2A5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the German Army as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). The vehicles of Panzerbataillon 33 and 214 were sent from Macedonia to Prizren. They were used for patrols, protecting checkpoints and bases as well as part of the show of force. On 13 June 1999, two members of the Serbian paramilitary started firing from inside a Fiat 125p car at one of the checkpoints in Prizren and both were killed by return fire. A Leopard 2A5 was located at the checkpoint, but it could not participate in the fighting as it was only partially crewed.[173]\\nOn 26 June 1999, a Leopard 2A5 fired four warning shots above the town of Orahovac.[174] From late 2000 to early 2001, the tanks were replaced by the Leopard 2A4 model. Leopard 2A4s were deployed to Macedonia in 2001 as part of the NATO intervention. The tanks served to protect Bundeswehr logistic sites in Macedonia. Until their return in 2004, the Leopard 2 tanks were stationed at the Austrian-Swiss camp \"Casablanca\".[174]\\nThe Dutch contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina operated Leopard 2 tanks.[175] Dutch Leopard 2A4s and Leopard 2A5s were stationed at the NLD bases at Bugojno, Novi Travnik, Sisava, Knezevo, Maslovare and Suica.[citation needed]\\nIn October 2003, Canada was planning to replace its Leopard C2s with wheeled Stryker Mobile Gun Systems. However, operational experience in Afghanistan and in particular during Operation Medusa, convinced the Canadian military of the usefulness of maintaining a tank fleet.[176] Leopard C2s were deployed to Kandahar in December 2006,[177] but they were by then almost 30 years old, and were nearing the end of their operational life. The Canadian government decided to borrow 20 Leopard 2A6s and three armoured recovery vehicles from Germany for rapid deployment to Afghanistan. In late August 2007, the first Leopard 2s were airlifted into Afghanistan to equip Lord Strathcona\\'s Horse (Royal Canadians).[178]\\nIn an assault on 2 November 2007, a Leopard 2A6M hit an improvised explosive device (IED) and survived without casualties: \"My crew stumbled upon an IED (improvised explosive device) and made history as the first (crew) to test the (Leopard 2A6) M-packet. It worked as it should.\" wrote a Canadian officer in an email to German defence officials.[179] Canadian Chief of the Defence Staff General Rick Hillier denied reports that a Leopard 2 tank that was struck by an IED was a write-off, insisting that the tank has been repaired and is once again in use. \"The Taliban have been engaged with some of the new Leopard 2 tanks in several ambushes\" and that as a result the Taliban \"learned some very harsh lessons\" and lost the battle in question \"very quickly and very violently.\"[180]\\nIn October 2007, Denmark deployed Leopard 2A5 DKs in support of operations in southern Afghanistan. The Danish tank unit, drawn from the first battalion of the Jydske Dragonregiment (Jutland Dragoons Regiment),[181] was equipped with three tanks and one M113 armored personnel carrier, with an armoured recovery vehicle and another tank kept in reserve.[182] The Danish version of the Leopard 2A5 is fitted with Swedish-made Barracuda camouflage mats that limit the absorption of solar heat, thus reducing infrared signature and interior temperature.[181] It also has a conventional driver\\'s seat bolted on the floor of the tank, whereas in the Canadian 2A6M (as part of the mine-protection package) the driver\\'s seat has been replaced by a \"dynamic safety seat\",[183] which is a parachute-harness like arrangement that the driver wears around his hip. This way, the driver does not have any contact with the hull except on the pedals and is out of the shockwave area of exploding land mines or IEDs.\\nIn January 2008, Danish tanks halted a flanking manoeuvre by Taliban forces near the Helmand River by providing gunfire in support of Danish and British infantry from elevated positions.[184] On 26 February 2008, a Danish Leopard 2 was hit by an explosive device, damaging one track. No one was injured and the tank returned to camp on its own for repairs.[185] The first fatality suffered by a crew operating a Leopard 2 happened on 25 July 2008. A Danish Leopard 2A5 hit an IED in Helmand Province. The vehicle was able to continue 200 metres (656\\xa0ft) before it halted.[186] Three members of the four-man crew were able to escape even though wounded, but the driver was stuck inside. Onsite treatment by Danish medics could not save him. The vehicle was towed to Forward Operating Base (FOB) Attal and then later to FOB Armadillo for investigation and possible redeployment. During the same contact with Taliban forces, a second tank was caught in an explosion but none of the crew were wounded.[186]\\nBeginning on 7 December 2008, Leopard 2 tanks took part in Operation Red Dagger, firing 31 rounds in support of Coalition troops as they recaptured Nad Ali District. A press release from the British Ministry of Defence praised the tank\\'s fire accuracy and mobility, claiming the Leopard 2 was a decisive factor in the coalition\\'s success.[187]\\nTurkey operates 354 Leopard 2A4 tanks. Initially using other tank types including upgraded M60s, in December 2016 Turkey deployed a number of Leopard 2A4s to the Syrian Civil War against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) as part of Operation Euphrates Shield.[citation needed] Initially, three of the Turkish Leopard 2A4s operating in Syria were destroyed or damaged by ISIS using anti-tank missile systems (possibly Fagot or Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles obtained from Syrian or Iraqi Army captured stocks).[citation needed] In mid-December 2016, two 2A4 tanks were captured by ISIS near al-Bab city in Syria during Euphrates Shield operations. Amaq News Agency posted video of vehicles claimed to be captured Leopard 2A4s.[188]\\nBy late December 2016, ISIS had captured or incapacitated 10 Leopard 2A4s. These were damaged by anti-tank weapons, IEDs, or other unknown causes.[189][190] Additional ISIS propaganda images and video depicting several completely destroyed Leopards, some with their turrets blown off, were published in January 2017.[191] Tanks which suffered the worst damage may have been destroyed by airstrikes in order to prevent capture but sources generally state that the damage was caused solely with anti-tank missiles or car bombs driven by suicide bombers.[192][193]\\nIn January 2017, the German newspaper Die Welt reported that ISIL fighters used 9M133 Kornet anti-tank missiles to destroy six Leopard 2 tanks used by the Turkish military in Syria.[194]\\nAt least eight Leopard 2 MBT have been destroyed according to photographic reports.[195]\\nTurkey also confirmed the use of Leopard 2A4 tanks during the Turkish military operation in Afrin to the German government. These tanks were designed during the Cold War to fight against Soviet tanks in Europe, not counterinsurgencies against guerrillas, where the primary risk is improvised explosive devices and anti-tank missiles. These tanks were retired from German usage when sold to Turkey.[196][197]\\nThere is a belief that the Turkish purchase of Leopard 2A4s from Germany was subject to the condition that they were not to be used against Kurdish separatists. Prior to 2016, the Leopard 2A4s were kept in northern Turkey. Once the German government discovered that the Leopard tanks were being used against Kurdish forces, planned upgrades to make them “less vulnerable to explosives” were halted. Ultimately Turkey was forced to upgrade the Leopard 2A4s with domestic components, including a possible replacement of the original turret with that of the Turkish Altay main battle tank.[196][198][199][200]\\nIn April 2023, during training of a Ukrainian crew a Leopard 2A4 was damaged with its turret being completely dislodged from the hull. The crew was reported as fine.[201] In July 2023, a Leopard 2A4 was modified to carry Kontakt-1 ERA on the sides of the hull and the turret. It was also shown with rubber screens attached to the turret and gun mantel.[109][202][203][204]\\nBeginning in June 2023, Ukraine deployed Leopard 2s during the Russo-Ukrainian War against Russia in preparation for their 2023 counteroffensive. During Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on 8 June 2023, a Russian artillery strike on a Ukrainian vehicle column at Novopokrovka destroyed at least one Leopard 2A4 tank.[205] Additionally, more Russian drone footage from the same day and days after showed 4 Leopard 2A6 tanks and 3 Leopard 2Rs damaged or destroyed south the road of Mala Tokmachka.[206]\\nOn 28 August 2023, Russia\\'s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed that Russian forces had destroyed or damaged all 16 Leopard 2A4 tanks supplied to Ukraine by Poland and Portugal.[207]\\nOn October 30th 2023, a video shows one Stridsvagn 122 tank was hit by a 9M133 Kornet.The missile hit the side of the vehicle and penetrated into the turret\\'s ammunition storage causing a cook-off, Yet the vehicles blowout panels protected the crew from the ammunition cooking-off. The crew was seen escaping the struck vehicle.[208]\\nAs of 27 December 2023, according to the Oryx blog, at least 15 Ukrainian Leopard 2s were destroyed according to photos and videos (4 Leopard 2A6, 1 Stridsvagn 122, 2 Leopard 2A4, 5 Leopard 2A4V, 1 Leopard 2R, 2 Bergepanzer-3); While another 19 Ukrainian Leopard 2s of various models were confirmed damaged to various degrees, with 10 of them being classified as abandoned by their crews: 7 Leopard 2A4/2A4V with 3 of them being abandoned, 7 Leopard 2A6 with 4 of them being abandoned, 3 Stridsvagn 122 all of whom were also abandoned and 2 Leopard 2R.[209] Totally, at least 25 Leopard-2 are losses and 9 more took damage requiring repair but are confirmed to have been recovered. The Oryx\\'s list only includes destroyed or damaged equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available, thus the amount of equipment lost could be higher than Oryx documented.[210]\\nOn 4 October 2023, according to Forbes, Ukrainian forces managed to recover at least one Strv 122 and have sent it to be repaired.[211]\\nThe baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the \"A0\" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first series manufactured version. The vehicles were manufactured from October 1979 until March 1982, altogether 380 vehicles. 209 were built by Krauss Maffei and 171 by MaK. The basic equipment consisted of electrical-hydraulic stabiliser WNA-H22, a fire control computer, a laser rangefinder, a wind sensor, a general-purpose telescope EMES 15, a panorama periscope PERI R17, the gunner\\'s primary sight FERO Z18, on the turret roof as well as a computer-controlled tank testing set RPP 1–8. 200 of the vehicles had a low-light enhancer (PZB 200) instead of thermal imaging. Two chassis served as driver training vehicles.[citation needed]\\nMinor modifications and the installation of the gunner\\'s thermal sight[1] were worked into the second batch of 450 vehicles Leopard 2, designated the A1. Krauss-Maffei built 248 (Chassis Nr. 10211 to 10458) and MaK built 202 (Chassis Nr. 20173 to 20347). Deliveries of the 2A1 models started in March 1982 and ended in November 1983. The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition racks to be identical to those in the M1A1 Abrams, and redesigned fuel filters that reduce refuelling time.[citation needed]\\nA third batch of 300 Leopard 2, 165 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr. 10459 to 10623) and 135 by MaK (Chassis Nr. 20375 to 20509.), was built between November 1983 and November 1984. This batch included more minor changes that were later retrofitted to the earlier 2A1s.[citation needed]\\nThis designation was given to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of the second and third batches. This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available. The upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling. There was an addition of a deflector plate for the periscope and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system. The tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position. The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987. The third, fourth and fifth batches, which were produced during this period, had the same features. The modernised first batch can be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the crosswind sensor for the fire control system was removed.[212]\\nThe fourth batch of 300 vehicles, 165 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr. 10624 to 10788) and 135 by MaK (Chassis Nr. 20510 to 20644), was delivered between December 1984 and December 1985. The main change was the addition of the SEM80/90 digital radio sets (also being fitted to the Leopard 1 at the same time), and the ammunition reloading hatches being welded shut. Even with these minor changes the new batch was known as the 2A3.[citation needed]\\nThe most widespread version of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A4 models included more substantial changes, including an automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system able to handle new ammunition types, and an improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armour. The Leopard 2s were manufactured in eight batches between 1985 and 1992. All the older models were upgraded to 2A4 standard. Until 1994, Germany operated a total of 2,125 2A4s (695 newly built and the rest modified older versions),[citation needed] while the Netherlands had an additional 445 tanks. The 2A4 was licensed and manufactured in Switzerland as the Panzer 87 \"Leopard\" or Pz 87. This version included Swiss-built 7.5\\xa0mm MG 87 machine guns and communications equipment and featured an improved NBC protection system. Switzerland operated 380 Pz 87 tanks.[citation needed]\\nAfter 2000, Germany and the Netherlands found themselves with large stocks of tanks that they had no need for after the Cold War. These tanks were sold to NATO or friendly armies around the world. Among these buyers of the surplus tanks were Turkey (purchasing 354 vehicles), Greece (183), Sweden (160), Chile (140), Finland (139), Poland (128), Austria (114), Spain (108), Canada (107), Indonesia (103), Singapore (96), Norway (52), Denmark (51), and Portugal (37).[213]\\nThe Pz 87WE (WertErhaltung) is a planned Swiss modification and upgrade of the Pz 87.[214] The modification significantly improves protection through the addition of the Leopard 2A6M\\'s mine protection kit, thicker armour on the front glacis, and a turret equipped with a Swiss-developed armour package using titanium alloy. The turret roof armour is improved and the smoke grenade launchers are redesigned. Further improvements enhance survivability and combat capabilities, such as a turret electric drive similar to the Leopard 2A5, a driver rearview camera, an independent weapons station for the loader, and enhanced command and control systems. The fire control system is upgraded, using the Carl Zeiss Optronics GmbH PERI-R17A2 fire control system. A remote weapons station containing a fully stabilised Mg 64 0.50 in (12.7\\xa0mm) machine gun is fitted to the tank.[citation needed]\\nThe Swiss company RUAG offered an upgrade package for Pz 87 main battle tanks to meet a possible requirement of the Swiss Army for improved protection. It is fitted with a new modular composite armour package. Armour modules can be tailored to provide enhanced protection against a specific threat. Damaged modules can be easily replaced in field conditions. Upgraded tanks are less vulnerable to direct hits, anti-tank missiles, RPG rounds, mines, and IEDs. The vehicle received new sensors such as a sniper detection sensor and a laser warning receiver.[215][216] In 2021, the two prototypes with add-on armour were handed to the Militär- und Festungsmuseum Full-Reuenthal.[217]\\nThe Indonesian Army operates the Leopard 2 Republic Indonesia or Leopard 2RI, an upgraded variant based on Rheinmetall\\'s MBT Revolution upgrade for the Leopard 2A4 tank. The upgrade includes AMAP armour from IBD Deisenroth and Rheinmetall Chempro, improved fire control systems, and battlefield management and situational awareness systems.[218][219]\\nThe Pz 87–140[220] is an experimental variant of the Swiss Pz 87 with a 140\\xa0mm gun and additional armour, which was later used on the newer production variants.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2A4CHL is the upgraded Chilean version of the Leopard 2A4 ordered by Chile in 2007. Upgrades include new electronics, sighting, and information systems meant to elevate the Leopard 2A4\\'s networking capability to be equal to that of the Leopard 2A6, a new suspension system, and the upgrading of the tank main gun to the L/55 smoothbore cannon used on the Leopard 2A6. Other upgrades are remote weapon stations over the gunner and commander hatches fitted with the MG3 and HK GMG. The Leopard 2A4CHL has improved roof and side turret armour and can be uplinked with Chile\\'s battlefield control network.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2A4M CAN is the upgraded Canadian version of the Leopard 2A4 acquired from the Royal Netherlands Army surplus. The Leopard 2A4M CAN is specially designed for the war in Afghanistan, based on experience gained by Leopard 2 operators. The first 20 were delivered in October 2010. Five were deployed to Afghanistan at the end of 2010 and operated until July 2011, when combat operations stopped.[221] Though originally planned to be up-gunned to the L/55 for consistency with the 2A6M CAN, the longer barrelled guns (optimised for tank-vs-tank warfare) were found to be less than ideal in Afghanistan, therefore it was decided to retain the L/44. Only small areas of slat armour were added, in contrast with the fully caged 2A6M CANs. The protection of the Leopard 2A4M CAN has been further augmented by the addition of applique armour resembling that found on the most recent Leopard 2A7+ variant, but modified to fit the turret configuration of the 2A4.[222] Of the 2A4s acquired, 11 were converted for training use (9 A4s, 2 A4Ms). In February 2011, Canada bought 12 2A4s/Pz 87 from Switzerland for the \\'Force Mobility Enhancement\\' project which, along with the remaining unused ex-Dutch tanks, saw 18 converted to Armoured Engineering Vehicles and 4 converted to Armoured Recovery Vehicles.[223] Canada has also purchased 15 2A4s from Germany as Logistic Stock Vehicles (for spare parts).\\nThe Leopard 2NG (Next Generation) is a privately funded Turkish upgrade by ASELSAN that includes the application of AMAP, upgraded optics, completely overhauled turret mechanics, and a new fire control system on the work since 1995 and to be delivered by late 2011, which is intended to be used on the new Altay MBT. It was developed without an order from the Turkish Army, but might meet the requirements for the modernization of the Turkish Leopard 2A4s.[224] The old powerpack and the L/44 gun barrel are kept, but the combat weight is increased to 65 tonnes.[224] According to Turkish news sources, Finland was interested in getting the Turkish upgrade package to modernise their fleet of Leopard 2A4s. However, in 2015 Finland purchased 120 2A6 vehicles from the Netherlands.[225][226]\\nThe Leopard 2 hull was used for the Vickers Mk 7 main battle tank, which featured a British-designed turret, where some of the innovations later were incorporated into the Challenger 2 design.[citation needed]\\nIn December 2015, Bumar-Labedy signed an agreement with German Rheinmetall Landsysteme Gmbh concerning the technological support of the Polish modernization program for Leopard 2A4 tanks. The company will design, document, and execute six prototypes. The first upgraded Leopard 2PLs have arrived in Poland in June 2020, with all 142 tanks to be delivered by 2023.[227] The upgrades include third generation night vision systems (production of the Warsaw PCO), new additional armour modules and anti-splash lining, removal of flammable components (turret drive system and main propulsion system), installation of the new fire protection system, modernization of the tank\\'s integrated monitoring and testing equipment, the possibility of using new types of ammunition (programmable DM-11 and DM-63), and an auxiliary generator set (APU). Construction of all 142 units will be completed by the end of 2020.[citation needed]\\nTurkey is planning to modernize its Leopard 2A4 MBTs as Leopard 2A4TR with the T1 Modernization Package.[clarification needed] According to the Defense Industry Presidency, Leopard 2A4 tanks will be modernized with; Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), T1 Reactive-Passive Armour, High Ballistic Strength Cage Armour, Hollow Modular Add-on Armour, Close Range Surveillance System (YAMGÖZ), Laser Warning Receiver System (LIAS), SARP Remote Controlled Weapon System (UKSS), PULAT Active Protection System (AKS), a new power distribution unit, ASELSAN Driver Surveillance System (ADİS) and voice alert system integrations. The modernization programme is to be completed in 2 batches. The programme will start with 84 Leopard 2A4 tanks in the first batch and the remaining tanks will be modernized within the 2nd batch. A total of 334 tanks (including prototypes) are planned to be upgraded with the T1 modernization programme. The new modernized Leopard 2A4 that was presented at the BMC factory was fitted with an Altay turret, which is armed with one 120\\xa0mm 55 caliber smoothbore gun designed and manufactured by the Turkish Company MKE, based on a technology transfer from Hyundai Rotem of South Korea. A remote-controlled weapon station is mounted on the top of the turret which is armed with a 12.7mm caliber heavy machine gun.[228][229][230][231][232][233]\\nOn 1 September 2023, video on social media showed Ukrainian crews with 30 Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt ERA and T-80U style rubber screens, denoted Leopard 2A4V.[234] This followed previous sightings in Ukraine of a Canadian supplied Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt-1 ERA.[109][204]\\nFinland has modernised its Marksman SPAAG vehicles by replacing the original T-55AM chassis with a newer Leopard 2A4 chassis.[235] The upgraded Marksman vehicles were scheduled to enter service with the Finnish Army in 2016.[236] The new Leopard 2 chassis greatly improves mobility compared to the older T-55AM chassis, both on- and off-road. The Leopard 2 chassis is larger, providing a more stable firing platform for the Marksman turret to operate from.[237]\\n\"Leopard 2 Improved\" was a series of three prototypes used to test possible further enhancements beyond the Leopard 2A4 model, developed beginning in 1988.[238] After a concept phase, a component test bed (KVT, Komponentenversuchsträger) was built in 1989, followed by two troop trial vehicles (TVM, Truppenversuchsmuster). The Leopard 2 Improved was mostly focused on improving armour protection, introducing the wedge-shaped, spaced add-on armour at the turret front, as well as hull and roof add-on armour, greatly improving protection against hollow charge and kinetic energy threats. It does not form a shot-trap, since it does not deflect the penetrators outwards to hit the hull or turret ring. The gun mantlet was redesigned to accept the new armour.[61] Aside of improved armour protection, these tanks also included improved optics, navigation systems and electronics.\\nFollowing the initial trials of the two TVM protoypes in Germany and an agreement of the Leopard 2 user states, the second TVM prototype was modified (becoming the TVM 2 mod.) by removing several parts such as the add-on hull and roof armour,[239] becoming the basis for the Leopard 2A5 model. One Leopard 2 Improved (TVM 2) competed in Sweden against the Leclerc and M1A2 Abrams, leading to the adoption of the Stridsvagn 122.\\nThe Leopard 2 Improved was developed into the Leopard 2A5. Most of its improvements were focused on armour protection; it was enhanced by adding external add-on modules to the turret and replacing the turret\\'s internal armour modules with ones of newer, improved composition.[240] The interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated.[240] The commander\\'s sight was moved to a new position behind the hatch and it received an independent thermal channel. The gunner\\'s sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models. A heavier sliding driver\\'s hatch was fitted.[241]\\nThe hydraulic turret drives were replaced by an all-electric system, increasing reliability and crew safety, as well as weight savings.[240] The gun braking system was improved to prepare for the later mounting of the new L/55 gun tube and to enable firing of more powerful ammunition, such as the DM53 APFSDS. The first A5s were handed over to the German army tank school in 1995 and started to enter regular service with Panzerbataillon 33 in December the same year.[241]\\nThe Leopard 2A5 DK is a variant of the Leopard 2A5 similar to the Leopard 2A6 with some small modifications, used by the Danish Army.[242]\\nStridsvagn 122 (also known as Leopard 2A5S[243] and Leopard 2 \"Improved\" A5 SE[244]\\n) is a Swedish Army tank based on the Leopard 2 Improved. 120 units were built, 91 of which were licence-produced in Sweden. The tank features increased armour on the turret top and front hull, and improved command-, control- and fire-control systems. Externally, it can be distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and the much thicker crew hatches.[61] The Strv 122B+ Evolution, a variant equipped with modular AMAP composite armour from IBD Deisenroth, has increased 360° protection against threats like EFPs, RPGs and IEDs.[245] The width of 4 metres (13\\xa0ft) has been kept, while the weight increases by only 350 kilograms (770\\xa0lb).[245]\\nIn the early 1990s,[citation needed] Rheinmetall began development of a 140\\xa0mm smoothbore cannon for use in future tank designs. The new gun was intended to counter new Soviet tank developments, especially since the next generation of Soviet main battle tanks were rumoured to be armed with a 135\\xa0mm or 152\\xa0mm cannon. The new 140\\xa0mm cannon was part of a modernisation programme for the Leopard 2 known as the KWS III.[246][unreliable source?] Test firing of the new 140\\xa0mm cannon was conducted. Results showed that the gun had high penetration values, and had a muzzle velocity of around 2,000 metres a second, with potential to be increased further. However, the 140\\xa0mm rounds were too heavy for the tank crew to handle effectively.[citation needed]\\nThe KWS III upgrade was to feature a new turret. This new turret was equipped with the planned 140\\xa0mm cannon and an autoloader. The introduction of an autoloader reduced the tank\\'s crew to three members, as a dedicated loader was no longer needed. The gun\\'s 32 rounds of ammunition were stored separate from the crew in a large compartment occupying the entire rear of the turret, in order to increase crew survivability in the event of a cook off. The turntable-style turret had the gun offset to the left side, due to the autoloader\\'s lateral feeding of ammunition into the cannon breech.[citation needed] The turret was powered by an electro-hydraulic drive and featured an IFIS battlefield management system. The crew was protected by an armoured capsule and ballistic protection for the hull was to be improved. The planned protection level of the KWS III upgrade was to be equal to or better than the Leopard 2A5.[42][246][unreliable source?]\\nA total of 650 Leopard 2 KWS III tanks were originally projected to be purchased.[43] However, in 1995, the KWS III programme was cancelled due to changes in the political environment.[clarification needed]\\nDespite this, development continued on the 140\\xa0mm cannon,[citation needed] with Rheinmetall coordinating with the British Royal Ordnance and French GIAT companies.[citation needed] The 140\\xa0mm cannon was fitted to an old Leopard 2 prototype with the turret T19.[247] Counterweights were added to the rear of the turret to balance the increased weight of the 140\\xa0mm cannon. The modified Leopard 2 was not equipped with any other KWS III upgrades apart from the new gun. Live fire testing showed mixed results, where the 140\\xa0mm cannon showed superior penetrating power compared to the existing 120\\xa0mm cannon, but demonstrated poorer handling characteristics.[246][unreliable source?] The lack of the autoloader on the prototype further hampered performance.[246][unreliable source?]\\nThe Leopard 2A6 includes the addition of the Rheinmetall 120\\xa0mm L/55 smoothbore gun and other changes. All German tank battalions of the \"crisis intervention forces\" are equipped with the A6. Canada purchased twenty Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands. These were delivered in 2007.[248] Portugal purchased 37 Leopard 2A6s from the Dutch in 2007, with delivery in 2008. In January 2014, Finland purchased 100 L2A6s, as well as munitions, simulators, and a ten-year supply of reserve parts from the Netherlands. The tanks were delivered in batches between 2015 and 2019.[249]\\nThe Leopard 2A6A1 is a command version of the Leopard 2A6, stemming from the KWS I programme. The vehicle includes additional radios (with the amount depending on the level of command) to accommodate the communications for section, platoon, troop, company, squadron or battalion commanders.[250] For section leaders, the vehicle is fitted with 1x SEM 80 and 1x SEM 90 VHF radios. For platoon or troop commanders, the vehicle is fitted with 1x SEM 80 and 1x SEM 90 VHF radios along with an 800m field telephone cable drum fitted at the rear of the vehicle. For company, squadron or battalion commanders the vehicle is fitted with 2x SEM 80 or 1x SEM 93 and 1x SEM 90 VHF radios along with an 800m field telephone cable drum, for either fitted at the rear of the vehicle.[250]\\nThe Leopard 2A6M is a version of the 2A6 with enhanced mine protection under the chassis, and internal enhancements to improve crew survivability.[251] In the summer of 2007, Canada borrowed 20 A6Ms from Germany for deployment to Afghanistan.\\nThe Leopard 2 Hel (\"Hellenic\") is a derivative of the 2A6 that was ordered by the Greek Army in 2003. The 170 tanks were delivered between 2006 and 2009. A total of 140 were built in Greece by ELBO, which delivered the first units in late 2006.[252]\\nThe Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian variant of the Leopard 2A6M. Significant modifications include distinctive black boxes mounted on the rear of the turret bustle,[253] and stand-off slat armour.[254] The first tanks configured in this variant were 20 loaned from the German Bundeswehr in an effort to increase firepower and protection given to Canadian troops operating in the south of Afghanistan. The loaned tanks retain their German MG3 machine guns, the ex-Dutch tanks are also expected to retain their FN MAG machine guns due to commonality with Canadian stocks of C6 GPMG, itself a variant of the FN MAG.[255]\\nDue to the loaned status of the first twenty tanks, the air conditioning unit originally could not be installed, as only minimal changes could be made. The crew wore cooling vests instead, and the turret\\'s electric drive generates less heat than the hydraulic drive of the older Leopard C2. The loaned German tanks will be kept by the Canadian Forces and may be further upgraded, while ex-Dutch Leopard 2A6s were modified to German Leopard 2A6M specifications and used as restitution for the loaned tanks.[256] Canadian Leopard 2s in Afghanistan were later fitted with air conditioning units, a much-needed commodity in the scorching desert of Afghanistan, and Saab\\'s Barracuda camouflage mats, which reduce solar loading by 50 percent.[69]\\nThe Leopard 2A6TR was the Turkish variant during the Turkish Army tank procurement project in 2000. The version was based on 2A6EX. The project was dropped in favor of developing the indigenous Altay (main battle tank).[257]\\nThe Leopard 2E is a derivative of the 2A6, with greater armour protection,[258] developed under a programme of co-production between the defence industries of Spain and Germany. The programme was developed within the frame of collaboration decided in 1995 between the Defence Ministries of both countries, which also included the cession of use by period of five years of 108 Leopard 2A4 from the German Army to the Spanish Army. The session was extended up to 2016, and after that those tanks will be the sole property of the Spanish Army, as has been made public in January 2006, then having been paid a total of €15,124,014 in ten yearly installments, giving the Spanish co-ownership from 2006.\\nIn 1998, the Spanish government agreed to locally build 219 tanks of the Leopard 2E line, 16 recovery tanks of Leopard 2ER (Buffalo), and 4 training vehicles. They chose Santa Bárbara Sistemas as the main contractor. The programme, with a budget of €1,939.4 million, includes integrated logistical support, training courses for crew instructors and maintenance engineers, and driving, turret, maintenance, aiming, and shooting simulators. Deliveries of the first batch began in 2004.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2PL is a Polish modernized version of the Leopard 2A4, carried out in cooperation with Rheinmetall and the Polish Armaments Group (Polish: Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, PGZ). The Leopard 2PL MBT is primarily tasked with assault, maintaining territory, and supporting mechanized and motorized subdivisions with its onboard weapon systems in all weather conditions during the day and night. The main upgrades when compared to the Leopard 2A4 include modernization of the commander\\'s and gunner\\'s sight, additional ballistic modules on the turret, replacement of the hydraulic stabilization system with a new electric system, and new fire extinguishing and fire suppression systems.[259][260]\\nThe upgrade included a new commander\\'s control and monitoring system, the installation of an auxiliary power unit (APU), a new turret stowage compartment for crew equipment, the modernization of its main gun to use new types of programmable ammunition, and the integration of day/night rear camera for drivers. Included are customized towing vehicles due to the increased weight of the upgraded tank.[259][260] The upgraded 2PL version is in service with the Polish Land Forces. Of the Leopard 2A4s from the first (128) and the second (14) batches, 24 have been upgraded to Leopard 2PL standard.[261] The rest will be upgraded to the 2PLM1 standard.[262]\\nThe new Leopard 2 PSO (Peace Support Operations) variant is designed especially for urban warfare, which had been encountered in peacekeeping operations with increasing frequency. The Leopard 2 PSO is equipped with more effective all-around protection, a secondary weapons station, improved reconnaissance ability, an obstacle clearance blade (OCB), a shorter gun barrel for manoeuvring on urban streets at the expense of fire range, non-lethal armament, close-range surveillance ability through camera systems, a searchlight and further changes to improve its perseverance and mobility in built-up non-wide open areas. These features are similar to the Tank Urban Survival Kit for the American M1A2 Abrams.[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2A7 vehicle is not intended to be optimized for combat in urban terrain, thus it is fundamentally different from the KMW variant, the: 2A7+ (see below). A total of 20 vehicles were provided for converting. It involves former Dutch A6NL models returned by Canada to Germany. The original upgrade to A6M has been extended in coordination with Canada and includes a crew-compartment cooling-system from the Leopard 2 A6M-HEL series, a new 20\\xa0kW auxiliary power unit based on the Steyr Motors M12 TCA UI engine,[263] the Saab Barracuda Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) with Heat-Transfer Reduction (HTR CoolCam) system,[264] a field trial proven combat management and information system (IFIS: Integriertes Führungs- und Informationssystem), onboard network optimization with ultracapacitors in the chassis and turret, a SOTAS IP digital intercom system, a renewal of the fire suppression system in the crew compartment, and the retrofitting of Attica thermal imaging module in the commander optics.[46]\\nThe weapon system is adapted for firing HE ammunition. It is fitted for, but not with, additional passive side protection armour. The first Leopard 2A7 was handed over to the German Army in Munich in December 2014. 14 vehicles were produced for Tank Battalion 203, 4 went to the Armoured Corps Training Centre and one vehicle went to the Technical School for Land Systems and School for Technology of the Army. The last tank remains as a reference vehicle at KMW.[46]\\nThe Danish Armed Forces received its first Leopard 2A7 main battle tanks upgraded in Germany from the Leopard 2A5DK version at the Dragoon Barracks in Holstebro. The Danish Army will receive a total of 44 Leopard 2A7 vehicles by 2022.[265]\\nSiemon T. Wezeman, senior researcher at SIPRI\\'s arms transfers and military expenditure programme, stated that information from the UN Register of Conventional Arms 2016, indicated that some Leopard 2A7s were transferred to Singapore after 2014. SIPRI reported that the Singapore Army probably acquired a total of 45 Leopard 2A7s between 2016 and 2019, but the Singapore\\'s Ministry of Defence denied having acquired the 2A7 version, presumably to minimise anxiety among her neighbors.[266][267][268]\\nIn February 2023, Norway ordered 54 Leopard 2A7 tanks to be delivered from 2026, with a further option for 18 vehicles if necessary.[269] This order was later changed into a newly specified 2A8 NOR subvariant of the 2A8.\\nThe Leopard 2A7+ was first shown to the public during the Eurosatory 2010, featuring the label \"Developed by KMW – tested and qualified by the German Ministry of Defence\". The Leopard 2A7+ has been tested by the Bundeswehr under the name UrbOp (urban operations).[citation needed]\\nThe Leopard 2A7+ is designed to operate both in low-intensity and high-intensity conflicts.[270] The tank\\'s protection has been increased by modular armour. The frontal protection has been improved with a dual kit on the turret and hull front, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the survivability of the tank in urban operations.[270] The modular armour\\'s system components were first used by Canada in Afghanistan.[271] It can fire programmable High Explosive munitions. The turret-mounted MG3 has been replaced with a stabilised FLW 200 remotely controlled weapon station. Mobility, sustainability, and situational awareness have also been improved.[270]\\nIn December 2018, Hungary ordered 44 2A7+s, making them the second operator of the improved version, after Qatar.[98][99]\\nTo replace the 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the German Ministry of Defence is expected to purchase a batch of at least 18 Leopard 2A8 tanks (with option for several hundred).[272] The plans still have to be approved by the German parliament due to the contract exceeding a value of €25 million.\\nItalian government confirmed during a Parliament audition that Italy intends to purchase up to 250 Leopard 2A8 tanks over 2023-2025 period.[273]\\nThe Leopard 2A8 will be based on the current Leopard 2A7HU production model but feature additional improvements; among them the integration of the Trophy APS and an all-round situational awareness system with sensor-fusion capability.[272]\\nThe Dutch MoD is planning on procuring up to 52 Leopard 2A8 tanks in addition to their 18 leased Leopard 2A6 tanks.[274] This planned acquisition is part of the nation\\'s effort to rebuild their army after severe budget cuts of the 21st century.\\nThe Czech Ministry of Defense is negotiating with Germany the purchase of 70-77 Leopard 2A8, including domestic manufacturing rights for aspects of the tank production.[275][276]\\nThe Norwegian armed forces\\' order of 54 Leopard 2A7NOs was changed into a new 2A8 NOR variant by the middle of June 2023. A variety of Norwegian changes and alterations necessitated the renaming of the original 2A7NO into a unique new 2A8 NOR variant. This subvariant mainly differs from the German 2A8 by integrating a Norwegian-designed C4IS-solution that includes Kongsberg\\'s ICS/CORTEX-solution and Teleplan Globe\\'s FACNAV/norBMS battlefield management system.\\n[277]\\nThe AEV 3 Kodiak is a combat engineering vehicle conversion of the Leopard 2 used by Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland. It is equipped with a bulldozer blade, excavator arm, and dual capstan winches.  In lieu of a turret, a Remote Weapon Station or other armaments can be fitted. It is built on the Leopard 2 chassis with a built-up forward superstructure. The vehicle is used primarily for the clearance of obstacles, including minefields. The Dutch version has additional bomblet protection for the crew compartments. Spain may procure 24 examples for the Spanish Army from converted Leopard 2A4 hulls (one vehicle has been trialled in Spain)[279] and the type will be offered to Germany.[citation needed]\\nRoad: ca. 340\\xa0L/100\\xa0km, ca. 340\\xa0km\\nTerrain: ca. 530\\xa0L/100\\xa0km, ca. 220\\xa0km\\nAverage: ca. 410\\xa0L/100\\xa0km, ca. 280\\xa0km\\nStatic test: 12.5\\xa0L/h, 72–93 hours (with 900–1,160\\xa0liters capacity)\\nIn May 2022 the Czech Ministry of Defence announced it will get 15 Leopards 2A4 from Germany as an exchange for Czech tanks that will be given to Ukraine to help defend against Russian invasion and may purchase up to 50 modern 2A7+ variants later.[298][299] It was later clarified that Czechia would received 14 Leopard 2A4 and 1 Bpz3 ARV.[300] The first Leopard 2A4 was delivered on 21 December 2022, and all 14 were delivered as of 21 November 2023.[301]\\nFollowing that some were sold and upgraded:\\nThe German Army also purchased:\\nSome of those were upgraded / transferred:\\nDelivery - 2024 - 2025\\nNew variant equipped with Active Protection System Trophy.\\nKMW manufactured 17 new chassis, Bundeswehr supplied 17 turrets of the Leopard 2A6A3 variant.[330]\\nThe Royal Netherlands Army previously operated 445 Leopard 2s. 330 of these were updated to 2A5 standard in 1993, and later, 188 of these were converted to 2A6 standard. The majority of these Leopard 2s were sold after the end of the Cold War. In April 2011, the Dutch Ministry of Defence announced that the last remaining tank division would be disbanded and the remaining Leopard tanks sold due to large budget cuts.[338] In May 2011, the last tank fired the final shot at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area. They were due to be delivered to the Indonesian Army, which planned to purchase the entire Dutch stock of Leopard 2A6s.[339] The deal was scrapped after opposition from the Dutch Parliament.[340] The Dutch Army offered its formerly operated Leopard 2A6s for comparative tests to be conducted by the Peruvian Army for possible acquisition.[341] By September 2013, the Leopard 2A6 had been disqualified by Peru due to logistical complexities.[342] The Leopard 2s were eventually sold to Finland in a deal signed in January 2014 for €200 million with deliveries to start from 2015 to 2019.[343] In September 2015, the Dutch government published that the army would have 16 tanks put out of storage. One Leopard 2 tank is exhibited at the military museum.[344]\\nAs of 2023, 134 upgraded Pz 87 WE tanks are active while the remaining 96 Pz 87s were decommissioned and placed in long-term storage,[389] and 49 Pz 87 have been transformed in engineering variants since 2011 (see below).\\nOn 3 March 2023 it was reported that Germany sought to purchase an unknown number of Switzerland\\'s 96 reserve tanks to backfill those given to Ukraine by other allies.[390] Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger later confirmed in an interview the company sought to purchase 36 of these tanks.[391] Switzerland\\'s Security Commission voted to fully decommission 25 of the tanks, enabling their re-sale back to the German manufacturer pending approval from parliament.[392] On November 22, the Swiss parliament approved their export to Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH in Germany subject to the condition they remain within Germany, NATO, or an EU partner and not be provided to Ukraine.[393]\\nBackground: History of the tank, Tank classification, Tanks in the Cold War\\nBackground: History of the tank, Tank classification\\n'),\n",
       " ('Pata (sword)',\n",
       "  'The patta (Marathi:दांडपट्टा) is a sword, originating from the Indian subcontinent, with a gauntlet integrated as a handguard.[1] Often referred to in its native Marathi as a dandpatta, it is commonly called a gauntlet-sword in English.\\nThe pata has a long straight blade ranging in length from 10 to 44\\xa0in (25 to 112\\xa0cm). The blades were locally made by native artisans.\\nThe characteristic feature of the pata is its hilt which takes the form of a half-gauntlet, the inside of which is usually padded. The hilt is attached to the blade by decorative arms that extend forward on both sides of the blade. \\nThe Mughals developed a variation with matchlock pistols adjoining the handle.[citation needed] The hilt also has a long cuff which is usually decorated and in older examples inlaid and embellished with gold and silver. The swordsman holds the weapon by gripping a crossbar inside the gauntlet. The cuff is held close to the forearm by another bar or chain.\\nCreated in Medieval India,[2] the pata\\'s use in warfare appears to be mostly restricted to the 17th[3] and 18th century[4] when the Maratha empire came into prominence. It was considered to be a highly effective weapon for infantrymen against heavily armoured cavalry.[citation needed] The Maratha ruler Shivaji I and his general Baji Prabhu Deshpande were reputedly trained in the use of the pata. When Mughal Afzal Khan\\'s bodyguard Sayyid Banda attacked Shivaji with swords in the Battle of Pratapgad, Shivaji\\'s bodyguard Jiva Mahala fatally struck him down, cutting off one of Sayyad\\'s hands with a pata.[5]\\nRecent discovery of Hero stone inscriptions has pushed back the antiquity of the pata to the 12th century.[6]\\nThe pata is most commonly paired with either a shield or another pata, though it can also be used with a javelin, axe, or belt. The restrictive handle was particularly suited to the stiff-wristed style of South Asian swordsmanship. Despite its shape, the pata is used primarily for cutting rather than thrusting.[4] The extended grip provided by the forearm permits powerful slashes but restricts any thrusts.[4] This can be seen in mardani khel today and in colonial descriptions which describe spinning techniques with dual pata \"much like a windmill\".[4]\\nMiniature paintings show that the pata was also wielded by mounted cavalry,[1] which has led some modern collectors to erroneously conclude that the weapon was used for thrusting from horseback. However, the restriction on wrist movement would have made it difficult to dislodge the pata from an opponent\\'s body, and doing so while mounted would most likely cause the swordsmen to fall off their horses. Rather, it is more probable that the pata was used in cut-and-run tactics, characteristic of the Maratha army. Cutting technique was practiced by slicing fruit on the ground like lemons or limes without touching the ground. This was and still is a common method of demonstration, often using a flexible blade to facilitate the trick. It is said that Maratha warriors would swing the pata in circular movement like whirlwind when encircled before they fell, so as to maximize the casualties on the opposition. It was to be effective when two soldiers fought together as pairs.[7][failed verification]\\n\\n'),\n",
       " ('Flakpanzer Gepard',\n",
       "  'The Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard (\"anti-aircraft-gun tank \\'Cheetah\\'\", better known as the Flakpanzer Gepard) is an all-weather-capable German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG).[1] It was developed in the 1960s, fielded in the 1970s, and has been upgraded several times with the latest electronics. It has been a cornerstone of the air defence of the German Army (Bundeswehr) and a number of other NATO countries.\\nIn Germany, the Gepard was phased out in late 2010 and replaced by the Wiesel 2 Ozelot Leichtes Flugabwehrsystem (LeFlaSys)  with four FIM-92 Stinger or LFK NG missile launchers. A variant with the  MANTIS gun system and LFK NG missiles, based on the GTK Boxer, was also considered.[2]\\nThe Gepard has seen combat in the Russo-Ukrainian War,[3][4] and makes regular headlines on the news.[4][5]\\nThe Gepard was developed during the 1960s[4][6][7] as a replacememnt for the M42 Duster.[7] Two projects were investigated. These were the ‘Matador’ (designed by Rheinmetall, AEG, Siemens, and Krauss-Maffei) and the ‘5PFZ-A’ (designed by Oerlikon, Contraves, Siemens-Albis, Hollandse Signaalapparaten and Kraus-Maffei/Porsche).[7] In 1969, construction began of four A prototypes testing both 30 and 35mm guns. In June 1970, it was decided to use the 35mm type. In 1971, twelve second phase B prototypes were ordered. In 1971 the Dutch army ordered a CA preseries of five vehicles based on a parallel development that had used a West German 0-series Leopard 1 vehicle made available by the West German government in March 1970 as the C-prototype.\\nThe Germans made a small preseries of both the B1 and B2R. In February 1973, the political decision was made to produce the type. In September 1973 the contract was signed with Krauss-Maffei for 432 B2 turrets and 420 hulls with a total value of DM 1,200,000,000. Each vehicle would be about three times the price of a normal Leopard 1. The first was delivered in December 1976. Belgium ordered 55 vehicles, which were identical to the German version. The Netherlands ordered 95 vehicles (designated Cheetah PRTL or Pantser Rups Tegen Luchtdoelen), split into three batches (CA1, CA2 and CA3), which were equipped with Philips radar systems.\\nSince the 1980s, Redeye and later Stinger MANPADS teams have been accompanying the Gepard units to take advantage of their long-range scanning capacity. To combine this capacity in a single unit, a missile system upgrade that mounts the Stingers in twin packs to the autocannons was developed. The system was tested by the German Bundeswehr but not bought due to budget restrictions. Instead, the Ozelot Light Air Defence System (LeFlaSys) was fielded for the three Airborne Brigades.\\nThe vehicle is based on the hull of the Leopard 1 tank[1][8] with a large fully rotating turret carrying the armament—a pair of 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons.\\nThe Gepard is based on a slightly modified chassis of the Leopard 1 main battle tank,[1][7][8] including the complete drive unit with a 37.4-liter 10-cylinder multi-fuel engine (type: MB 838 CaM 500) with two mechanical superchargers built by MTU Aero Engines. The V-engine with a cylinder angle of 90 degrees has 610\\xa0kW at 2200 RPM (830\\xa0PS) and consumes—depending on the surface and driving style—around 150 liters per 100 kilometers. To ensure a steady supply of oil, even in difficult terrain and under extreme skew, the engine is provided with a dry sump forced lubrication. Even the gearbox (type: 4 HP-250) from ZF Friedrichshafen and the exhaust system with fresh air admixture to reduce the infrared signature were taken from the Leopard 1 main battle tank.\\nThe Gepard is equipped with a Daimler-Benz (type: OM 314) 4-cylinder diesel auxiliary engine for the energy supply system. This engine is on the front left of the vehicle, located where the Leopard 1 has an ammunition magazine. The engine, which has a 3.8 liter capacity, is designed as a multi-fuel engine and produces 66\\xa0kW (90\\xa0PS). It consumes between 10 and 20 liters per hour, depending on the operational status of the tank.\\nThe auxiliary engine is coupled with five generators to operate at different speeds: Two Metadyn machines in tandem with a flywheel (which is used to store energy during the acceleration and deceleration of the turret) for the power of the elevation and traverse drives, two 380\\xa0Hz three-phase generators with a capacity of 20 kVA for the ventilation, fire-control and radar systems, and a 300\\xa0A 28\\xa0volt direct current generator for the electrical system. The fuel capacity is 985 liters, which ensures a combined operating time of approximately 48 hours.\\nThe chassis and the track were taken directly from the Leopard 1. It has torsion bar spring-mounted roadwheels with seven roadwheel pairs per side. They are connected to the torsion bars on swing arms, whose deflection is limited by volute springs. Drive is through the drive sprockets located at the rear.\\nThe rubber-mounted shocks were modified to achieve better stability during firing. The track is manufactured by the company Diehl, rubber track pads fitted, and is \"live\" track with rubber bushings between the track links and pins (type: D 640 A). Grouser/icecleats can replace the rubber pads on some track links to increase traction on slippery surfaces.\\nThe hull only had slight modifications, i.e. a modified roadwheel distance (8\\xa0cm increased distance between the third and fourth roadwheel) and the transfer of additional batteries in battery boxes at the rear. The batteries and the electrical system operate at 24 volts DC.\\nVehicles delivered to the German Bundeswehr and Belgium were equipped with a Siemens MPDR 12 S-band search radar installed on a swing arm (lowered behind the turret for transit) on the rear of the turret, which provides a 15\\xa0km hemispherical detection range and has an integrated MSR 400 Mk XII interrogator for automated target discrimination. The Ku band tracking radar also developed by Siemens-Albis has a 15\\xa0km range and is mounted at the front of the turret, between the guns; its dome-covered antenna is mounted on a powered base which can traverse in a 180° arc. Additionally, the Gepard has a back-up optical sighting system for passive target acquisition and engagement, consisting of two stabilized, panoramic periscopes for both gunner and commander, with a variable magnification (1.5× and a field of view of 50° and 6× magnification with a narrow, 12.5° FOV). These periscopes can be mechanically engaged by the tracking radar and automatically aimed at the target for preliminary identification. A laser rangefinder was provided on vehicles upgraded to the B2L standard, and installed atop the antenna housing for the tracking radar.\\nThe Gepard utilizes two Oerlikon GDF, 90 calibres (3.15\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 4\\xa0in)) long,[7] with a muzzle velocity of 1,440\\xa0m/s (4,700\\xa0ft/s) (FAPDS (Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot) rounds), giving an effective range of 5.5\\xa0km (3.4\\xa0mi). The ammunition is 35×228mm calibre[7] (STANAG 4516).\\nThe KDA autocannon has a dual belt feed for two different ammunition types; the usual loading per gun is 320 AA rounds fed from inside the turret and 20 AP rounds fed from a small outlying storage. The 40 armour-piercing rounds are normally fired singly with the guns alternating; they are also intended for self defence against light armoured ground targets.\\nEach gun has a firing rate of 550 rounds/min. The combined rate of fire is 1,100 rounds/min, which – in unlimited mode – gives a continuous fire time of 35 seconds before running out of ammunition (with 640 AA rounds for both guns). It is standard to fire bursts against air targets, 24 rounds per gun for a total of 48 in limited mode and 48 rounds per gun for a total of 96 in normal mode.[citation needed] The Ukrainian air defence have found that the guns \"take an hour-and-a-half to reload\", thus limiting their effectiveness.[9]\\nThe guns can be elevated to almost a 90-degree vertical angle.[7]\\nThere are two variants of Gepard in service; the Dutch variant has a different radar installation.\\n\\xa0Germany\\n\\xa0Netherlands\\nThe Gepard has been deployed by Ukraine in its defense against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[10] The first three Gepards arrived in Ukraine on 25 July 2022.[11][5]A test showed that a supply of ammunition manufactured in Norway could not be fired by the Gepard, with a subsequent test of improved ammunition scheduled for August 2022.[12] By 20 September 2022 thirty Gepards and 6,000 rounds had been delivered.[13] According to Ukraine\\'s Armed Forces about 50,000 Norwegian made rounds for the Gepard had been received by 26 September 2022.[14] Photos from the German tabloid Bild of the Gepard with a Ukrainian crew include high-explosive incendiary (HEI) rounds (where the projectile is yellow with a red band) made by e.g. Norwegian Nammo.[15][16]\\nAccording to a Ukrainian defense attache in the United States the Gepard has been used to \"great effect\" against the \"relatively crude\" loitering munition believed to be Iranian-made Shahed-136.[17] The Conflict Intelligence Team considers it likely that a Gepard destroyed a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile as it was targeting a Kyiv power plant on 18 October 2022.[18] One unit is credited with destroying more than ten Shahed-136 drones and two cruise missiles.[19] Such systems are more effective and hence more cost-effective than more advanced and expensive air defence systems such NASAMS or IRIS-T missiles, while being less politically sensitive as they only have a limited effective range.[20] The  London-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) wrote: \"In general, gun systems are preferred over missiles where possible due to the much lower cost per engagement and higher availability of ammunition compared with SAMs and MANPADS\".[21] Ukraine allegedly suffered its first Gepard loss in April 2023 to a Lancet loitering munition,[22] although the full video shows the Gepard relatively intact after the impact. A retired Gepard operator of the 10th Panzer Division from Germany confirmed with his source in Ukraine that the Gepard still functioned after the hit.[23]\\nOn 2 December 2022, Germany recovered seven additional Gepard tanks from the \"scrap pile\" to be refurbished and sent to Ukraine, bringing the total units sent to Ukraine at 37. In May 2023 all 15 Gepards sold to Qatar in 2020 were purchased back by Germany, bringing the total pledged up to 52.\\nObtaining ammunition was initially difficult as Switzerland claimed that owing to its neutrality it should forbid Germany to transfer its stock, and refuse to supply its surplus,[24] forcing Germany to rely on other sources for ammunition.[25] However, on 15 December Rheinmetall committed to a new factory in Germany to sidestep the Swiss re-export ban.[26] A deal to start production was signed in February 2023[27] and the first shipment of new ammunition was delivered to Ukraine in September 2023.[28] Germany delivered the last 3 pledged Gepards to Ukraine by 22 December 2023 along with an additional 30,240 rounds of new ammunition.\\n'),\n",
       " ('Ballistic knife',\n",
       "  '\\nA ballistic knife is a knife with a detachable blade that can be ejected to a distance of several meters/yards by pressing a trigger or operating a lever or switch on the handle.[1][2] Spring-powered ballistic knives first appeared in books and press reports on Soviet and Eastern Bloc armed forces in the late 1970s.  Commercially-produced ballistic knives briefly gained notoriety in the United States in the mid-1980s after they were marketed and sold in the United States and other Western countries. Since then, the marketing and sale of ballistic knives to civilians has been restricted or prohibited by law in several nations.\\nIn its spring-propelled form, the blade of a ballistic knife is theoretically capable of being fired to an effective range of around 5 meters (about 16 feet) at a speed of 63\\xa0km/h (39\\xa0mph).[2][3] Ballistic knives using compressed air or gas propulsion to fire the blade can be made somewhat more powerful, and do not suffer from spring fatigue over time.\\nIn addition to spring, air, or gas propulsion, the blade of a ballistic knife may also be propelled by an explosive charge, such as a blank pistol cartridge.\\nThe first press reports of what became known as the ballistic knife appeared in the late 1970s in connection with the Soviet Union\\'s special operations forces.  In his book Inside The Aquarium, Viktor Suvorov described a ballistic knife as part of a Soviet spetsnaz trooper\\'s equipment.[4]\\nAn NRS-2 combination knife/gun was designed and developed during the 1970s at the order of the Russian Ministry of Defence and KGB of the USSR.[5] However, the NRS-2 was not in fact a ballistic knife, but a gun hybrid (instead of launching the blade, a small barrel aligned with the blade fires a non-standard 7.62mm bullet).\\nCommercial versions of the ballistic knife first appeared in the US market in the mid-1980s.  After hearing uncorroborated testimony from a congressional witness that ballistic knives could be used to defeat body armor typically worn by police officers, and witnessing a staged demonstration against a wood-backed target,[6] Senator Alphonse D\\'Amato of New York introduced the Ballistic Knife Prohibition Act, a bill to ban sale or possession of ballistic knives. The bill eventually failed. However, after gaining the support of Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,[7] congressional support for a ban on import or possession of ballistic knives quickly gained traction. In September 1986 senators supporting the ballistic knife ban attached their bill to popular legislation designed to eradicate drug crops in foreign countries and halt international drug trafficking operations. The bill was subsequently enacted into law. The new federal statute prohibited future importation or possession of such knives in interstate commerce. Some individual states following the example set by the federal law and passed even tighter restrictions, sometimes banning ownership of the knives outright within their state.[8]\\nSimilar to conventional automatic knives, federal law makes ballistic knives with a spring-operated blade[9] illegal to possess, manufacture, sell, or import \"in or affecting interstate commerce.\"[10] This means they are illegal to import from outside the United States, as well as buy or sell over state lines, including possessing or making them with intent to sell over state lines. The federal law also makes it a separate crime to use or possess a ballistic knife during the commission of a federal crime of violence, with a minimum sentence of 5 years in a federal prison. Federal law does not prohibit the possession, manufacture, or sale of a ballistic knife within a state\\'s boundaries, and the individual laws of each state or territory must be consulted to determine whether possession, manufacture, or sale within a given state is legal (many states have statutes that regulate or prohibit the acquisition or possession of ballistic knives, and penalties vary from state to state). Like the federal switchblade law, an exception is made for sale to the United States Armed Forces within the confines of a contract, as well as possession by duly-authorized members of the Armed Forces in performance of their duty.[11]\\nA ballistic knife with a blade propelled by an explosive charge falls outside the Federal law pertaining to these devices, but still may be restricted as this makes it a firearm subject to the Any Other Weapons (AOW) category of the National Firearms Act.\\nPossession of ballistic knives and pilum knives is illegal under current legislation in the United Kingdom.[12][13] and this has resulted in a tendency to interpret any bladed object of questionable status as falling within the definition of a prohibited knife.[13]\\nWhilst \"ballistic knives\" are not specifically mentioned in any legislation, the marketing, sale, transfer, or possession in a public place of a ballistic knife could be construed to be illegal under the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, the Knives Act 1997, the Criminal Justice Act 1988, and the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 imposes criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, sells or hires, or offers for sale or hire, or lends or gives to any other person \"any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife.\"[14] The Knives Act 1997 prohibits the marketing of knives as offensive weapons, while the Criminal Justice Act 1988 prohibits the carrying of blades or sharply pointed objects in a public place without \"good reason or lawful authority\". Finally, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without \"lawful authority or reasonable excuse.\" The term \"offensive weapon\" is defined under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 as: \"any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use\". Under the Prevention of Crime Act, knives otherwise \\'exempt\\' from penalty under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 when carried for \"good reason or lawful authority\" may still be deemed illegal if authorities conclude the knife is being carried as an \"offensive weapon\" without \"lawful authority or reasonable excuse\".[15] \\'Lawful authority\\' means those occasions where people from time to time are required to carry weapons as a matter of governmental duty, such as police officers or members of the armed forces, not private persons, hence the \\'lawful authority\\' language cannot be relied upon to establish an exemption from prosecution of private individuals.[15][16] Furthermore, as the ballistic knife was originally designed as an offensive weapon and given current prosecutorial directives,[12] it may be difficult to establish \"reasonable excuse\" for carrying such a knife before a UK prosecutor or court,[15] especially as the carrying of a knife in public for self-defence is not acceptable as a \"reasonable excuse\".[17] In the eyes of the law, claims of self-protection are presently viewed as an admission that the defendant intends to use the knife in violation of the law as an \"offensive weapon\" - albeit in a defensive manner, and in otherwise justifiable circumstances.[17]\\n'),\n",

       "  \"\\nThe Saudi Arabia national football team (Arabic: المنتخب السُّعُودِيّ لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) represents Saudi Arabia in men's international football. They are known as Al-Suqour Al-Khodhur (The Green Falcons) in reference to their traditional colours of green and white and represent both FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\\nConsidered one of Asia's most successful national teams, Saudi Arabia have won the AFC Asian Cup three times (1984, 1988 and 1996), reached a joint record six Asian Cup finals and have qualified for the FIFA World Cup on seven occasions since debuting at the 1994 tournament. Saudi Arabia are the first Asian team to reach the final of a senior FIFA competition at the 1992 King Fahd Cup, which would eventually become the FIFA Confederations Cup. Only Australia and Japan managed to repeat this feat in 1997 and 2001 respectively, though Australia achieved it when they were a member of the OFC.\\nAt the 1994 World Cup, under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to Sweden in the Round of 16. Thus, they became the second Arab team in history to reach the round of 16 of a World Cup after Morocco at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and one of the few Asian national football teams (others being Australia, Japan, South Korea and North Korea) to accomplish such a feat to date.\\nDuring the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Saudi Arabia caused a large upset when they beat eventual champions Argentina 2–1, the first time Argentina lost to an Asian representative in a FIFA World Cup. However, Saudi Arabia then lost the following matches against Poland and Mexico, and were knocked out 4th in the group stage of the World Cup.\\nIn 2027, Saudi Arabia will host the AFC Asian Cup. It will be the first time that the nation has ever hosted an Asian Cup.[5] They will also host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.\\nThe idea of a Saudi national team first came about in 1951, when a Saudi XI team consisting of players from Al-Wehda and Al-Ahli took part in a friendly game against the Egyptian Ministry of Health on 27 June at the Al-Saban Stadium in Jeddah. The following day, the Egyptians took on a Saudi team made up of players from Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal in Al-Bahri in the same city. On 2 August, His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal organized a third friendly with the Egyptian team against Saudi Arabia with players from Al-Wehda, and Al-Ahli. By then, the idea of a national select team to represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was already in full flow, and in 1953 the first-ever Saudi team traveled to play friendly matches abroad. The same year, a Saudi team traveled to Damascus to play friendly matches as part of then-Crown Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz's visit to the country in April.[6]\\nIn 1957, the Saudi national team took part in their first international tournament at the 2nd Pan-Arab Games in Beirut, where King Saud was invited to attend the opening ceremony and the inauguration of the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium with Lebanese President Camille Chamoun on 18 October. Abdulmajeed Kayal scored for the Saudis while Levon Altonian netted for the home side.[7]\\nThough their football federation was established in 1956, the Saudi Arabia national team did not participate in a tournament until they qualified for the AFC Asian Cup in 1984, and became the champions for the first time.[8] Since then, they reached the next four consecutive Asian Cup finals, winning two of them (1988 and 1996).[9][10] They have qualified for every AFC Asian Cup since, reaching the final in the 2007 edition.[11]\\nSaudi Arabia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1994 under the leadership of Argentine manager Jorge Solari and talents like Saeed Al-Owairan and Sami Al-Jaber, reinforced by national veteran Majed Abdullah as team captain. Wins against Belgium and Morocco in the group stage led to a match-up against Sweden in the round of 16, a 3–1 loss.[12] Saudi Arabia qualified for the next three World Cups, but failed to win a match in any of them; in 1998, the team suffered an agonizing group stage elimination for the first time after only a draw was gained, which happened against South Africa after Saudi Arabia squandered their original 2–1 lead while losing two earlier fixtures against Denmark and eventual champions and hosts France, while the team placed last in 2002 without scoring a goal, while conceding 12, including eight against Germany, the most humiliating World Cup performance ever by an Asian team since 1954, and the team did no better in 2006 after winning only a single point against Arab rival Tunisia, and also squandered a 2–1 lead in the last minutes before losing to Ukraine and Spain in an identical version to the 1998 participation.[13]\\nMeanwhile, after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, Saudi Arabia suffered even further setbacks. The Saudis failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in agonizing playoffs that saw them again squandered their 2–1 lead to a 2–2 draw to neighbor Bahrain.[14] In the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, the Saudis went on to have the worst-ever Asian Cup performance in the history, losing all three games in a shocking style to Syria, Jordan and Japan.[15] Later on, Saudi Arabia failed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, failing in the third round to Australia and Oman. This embarrassing record kept following the Saudis into the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, as the Saudis suffered another group stage exit, this time losing to China and Uzbekistan, and only gained a single win over North Korea.[citation needed]\\nSaudi Arabia secured qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, their first in 12 years,[16] ahead of Australia. In the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening match, Saudi Arabia face hosts Russia as the Russian annihilated them in the opening match 5–0,[17] making this the second largest victory of any host.[18] Saudi Arabia then lost 1–0 to a Luis Suárez goal that put Uruguay as the eventual group winners.[19] Although they were already eliminated,[20] Saudi Arabia managed to salvage some pride by winning their final group stage match against Red Sea neighbours Egypt.[21]\\nAfter the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Saudi Arabia participated in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, held in the United Arab Emirates; the team finished second in the group stage, after falling to Qatar in the final game,[22] leading to a showdown against Japan in the round of 16. The Saudis dominated the whole game, but ultimately lost 1–0 due to poor finishing.[23]\\nOn 15 October 2019, Saudi Arabia played its first-ever game with Palestine in the West Bank; the game marked a change in policy for Saudi Arabia, which has previously played matches against the Palestinian team in third-party countries. The visit was condemned by some Palestinian activists, who considered the game as a start of normalizing the relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, but it was viewed by the Palestinian National Authority as a support for their sovereignty over the West Bank.[24] The game ended in a scoreless draw.[25]\\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the first to be held in the Middle East, by topping their qualifying group and were drawn against Argentina, Poland and Mexico.[26] In the opening game of their group, they defeated a much fancied Argentina side 2–1 within just five minutes in the early of the second half with goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and the beautiful curl of Salem Al-Dawsari, ending an Argentine unbeaten streak of 36 games dating back to 2019. The Saudi King declared a Holiday after the win over Argentina and Saudi fans celebrated with mocking words against Lionel Messi, Argentine team and the other opponents.[27][28] They then lost their next match against Poland, 2–0. Piotr Zieliński broke Saudi hearts with a goal in 39th minute; Salem Al-Dawsari's penalty was saved by Polish goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny in the first half when the score was 1–0 while Abdulellah Al-Malki made a mistake to allow Robert Lewandowski to score his first World Cup goal.[29] This made Saudi require a win against Mexico to advance to the Round of 16 regardless of the Argentina-Poland result. Facing a team that was also playing its qualification in this last game in the same Lusail Iconic Stadium, Saudi Arabia opted to play all-out attack by fielding three strikers in front, but this proved fatal as the Saudis failed to repeat their inaugural achievement and ended up losing the match 2–1 after goals from Henry Martín and Luis Chávez, conceding both goals in just a similar five minutes span (the same span Saudi Arabia shocked Argentina) in the second half.[30] As a result, Saudi Arabia finished bottom in their group and were eliminated from the 2022 World Cup in the group stages at the despair of Saudi fans, as Saudi Arabia's knockout stage waiting hurt extended to 32 years since their only successful qualification in 1994. Moreover, the defeat also nailed the coffin to West Asian football, as all three representatives from West Asia in the first World Cup in the region (Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia) were all eliminated. Still, as Argentina subsequently walked on to eventually claim the 2022 FIFA World Cup title, the shock win Saudi Arabia gained against Argentina, the only team of the tournament to have beaten the Albiceleste, was a major consolation for the country's early World Cup exit.\\nTraditionally, Saudi Arabia's home kit is white with green trim, and the away kit is green with white trim (flag colors).[31] From 2023, the team had a color kit reversal where green is the home kit, and white is their away kit. \\nSaudi Arabia's main rivals are mostly from the same Persian Gulf, notably Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\\nDue to historical reasons, matches against Iran have been frequently followed and seen by Saudis as the most important rival. This stems from the strong hatred between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in particular in recent years due to historical enmities. Iran is leading the series by one game. Saudi Arabia has 4 wins, 6 draws, and 5 losses against Iran. It's one of 10 most heated rivalries with political influence.[34][35]\\nSaudi Arabia's other heated rival is Iraq. However, the rivalry only began in the 1970s. Due to the Gulf War, in which Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia's ally Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq eventually became bitter rivals fighting to salvage Arab pride.[36] The two countries since then have an up-and-down in relations, often ranged from lack of cooperation and political confrontation. Iraq almost pulled out of the 21st Arabian Gulf Cup after the country was disallowed to host the competition in a move believed to be motivated by Saudi Arabia.[37][38]\\nOutside the West Asian border, Saudi Arabia also has other rivalries with fellow Asian powerhouses like Japan, Australia, and South Korea; as well as having rivalries with Arab opponents of North Africa, mostly Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia.\\nHistorically, Saudi Arabia played most of their home matches in King Fahd International Stadium, located in the capital Riyadh. The stadium was also where some of Saudi Arabia's most important fixtures were when the country hosted the first three King Fahd Cups (predecessor of the Confederations Cup). The stadium was also home to some of Saudi Arabia's big games in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.\\nSaudi Arabia started to diversify the use of venues from outside Riyadh in the 2000s, with the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers first round played in Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam and the second round played entirely in Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers second round against Sri Lanka and at the first fixture against Uzbekistan in the third round, Saudi Arabia played again in Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium. It was accelerated from 2010s onward as Saudi Arabia began to play frequent home fixtures in newly built King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah and Mrsool Park also in Riyadh.\\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\\n\\xa0\\xa0Win\\n\\xa0\\xa0Draw\\n\\xa0\\xa0Loss\\n\\xa0\\xa0Fixture\\nThe following 26 players were called up for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[41]\\nCaps and goals are correct as of 10 January 2024, after the match against \\xa0Hong Kong, as recognized by SAFF.\\nThe following players have also been called up to the Saudi Arabia squad within the last 12 months.\\n\\n\\xa0 Champion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Runners-up\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Third place\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe following table shows Saudi Arabia's all-time international record, correct as of 28 March 2023.\\n\"),\n",
       " ('KitchenAid',\n",
       "  'KitchenAid is an American home appliance brand owned by Whirlpool Corporation. The company was started in 1919 by The Hobart Manufacturing Company to produce stand mixers; the H-5 is the first model that was introduced. The company faced competition as rivals moved into this emerging market, and introduced its trademarked silhouette in the 1930s with the model \"K\", the work of designer Egmont Arens. The brand\\'s stand mixers have changed little in design since, and attachments from the model \"K\" onwards are compatible with the modern machines.\\nDishwashers are the second product line to have been introduced, in 1949. A late 1980s promotional campaign on the back of an expansion by retailer Williams Sonoma saw brand awareness double in three years.\\nThe idea of a stand mixer was formulated by Herbert Johnston, an engineer working at the Hobart Corporation. He had been inspired after seeing a baker mix dough, and thought that there must be a better way of doing the task. In 1914, development began, and soon the model \"H\" mixer was launched for industrial work. The U.S. Navy ordered mixers for two new Tennessee-class battleship, California and Tennessee, as well as the U.S. Navy\\'s first dreadnought battleship, South Carolina. In 1917, Hobart stand mixers became standard equipment on all U.S. Navy ships, prompting development to begin on the first home models.[1]\\nThe first machine with the KitchenAid name is the ten-quart C-10 model, introduced in 1918 and built at Hobart\\'s Troy Metal Products subsidiary in Springfield, Ohio.[2]  Prototype models were given to the wives of factory executives, and the product was named when one stated \"I don\\'t care what you call it, but I know it\\'s the best kitchen aid I\\'ve ever had!\" They were initially marketed to the farmhouse kitchen and were available in hardware stores.[3] But owing to\\nthe difficulty in convincing retailers to take up the product, the company recruited a mostly female sales force, which sold the mixers door-to-door.[1]  The C-10 machine was also marketed heavily toward soda fountains and small commercial kitchens, and was also sold under the FountainAid and BakersAid model names.[4]\\nIn 1922, KitchenAid introduced the H-5 mixer as its new home-use offering.[5]  The H-5 mixer was smaller and lighter than the C-10, and had a more manageable five-quart bowl. The model \"G\" mixer, about half the weight of the \"H-5\" was released in August 1928.[6] In the 1920s, several other companies introduced similar mixers, and the Sunbeam Mixmaster became the most popular among consumers until the 1950s.[7]\\nKitchenAid mixers remained popular, and in the late 1930s, the factory would completely sell out its products each Christmas. The factory was closed for the duration of World War II. After the war, production started up again in 1946 when the factory moved to Greenville, Ohio, to expand capacity.[1]\\nThe product range expanded beyond stand mixers for the first time in 1949, when dishwashers were introduced.[3]\\nIn 1985, the company purchased the Chambers Company to incorporate its range of cookers into the KitchenAid brand.[1] After being cleared by a federal appeals court in January 1986, Whirlpool Corporation was cleared to purchase KitchenAid for $150 million, after initial complaints regarding competition from dishwasher manufacturers White Consolidated Industries and Magic Chef were dismissed.[8][9] Refrigerators were added to the product line later in 1986.[1] The company used the popularity of celebrity chefs during the late 1980s to seize the chance to expand its customer range. In 1988, retailer Williams Sonoma was opening new stores across the United States and released a cobalt blue stand mixer for the company. Although the retailer had been carrying KitchenAid products since 1959, the new stores introduced the mixers to a wider range of home cooks. This combined with a change in marketing strategy for KitchenAid, which resulted in a doubling of brand awareness over the course of the following three years.\\nKitchenAid began manufacturing blenders and other small appliances in the mid-1990s. The brand was further promoted by sponsoring the PBS show Home Cooking, and by introducing the mixers to television chefs such as Julia Child and Martha Stewart. Following the success with Williams Sonoma, specific points of purchase were set up in department stores such as Kohl\\'s and Macy\\'s. Specific color mixers were released for specific retailers or to benefit charities, such as a pink mixer released to raise funds for breast cancer research or mixers sold at Target stores being available in that company\\'s signature shade of red. The ProLine range of appliances was launched in 2003 with an initial six-month exclusivity agreement with Williams Sonoma.[10]\\nEgmont Arens was hired in the 1930s to design a low-cost series of mixers. This resulted in the production of the KitchenAid Model \"K\" which featured a streamlined profile for the first time, and the KitchenAid standard design has remained relatively unchanged since then.[11] The silhouette has since been made a registered trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[11] In 1997 the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art selected the KitchenAid stand mixer as an icon of American design.  There is an attachment hub on the front of each mixer. Every KitchenAid mixer since the introduction of the Model \"K\" has allowed for cross-generational attachment compatibility, meaning that attachments from the 1930s can be used on modern mixers, and vice versa. This cross-generational compatibility extends only to attachments powered through the hub. Other accessories (beaters, bowls, etc.) are not necessarily compatible even across similar models in production at the same time (for example, not all current production six-quart bowl-lift mixers use the same accessories).[12] Initially the mixers were only available in white; a range of four colors was introduced in 1955.[11]\\nSome KitchenAid products are manufactured in Ohio, South Carolina, Iowa, Mississippi, Indiana, Arkansas, Ontario, and Quebec and others are manufactured in China,[13] and its appliances are distributed throughout North America. All KitchenAid stand mixers are assembled in its factory in Greenville, Ohio. The die-cast parts of the machines come from various manufacturing plants around the world. A factory tour, known as the \"KitchenAid Experience\" is conducted by the assembly line workers.[14]\\nIn March 2016, KitchenAid announced that it would offer a line of food mixes with a Michigan food company, Franzese USA, Inc.[15] In their press release, KitchenAid states, “Considering that tens of millions of American kitchens are outfitted with our stand mixers, we’re confident that these mixes will become a staple in many pantries.”[16]\\n'),\n",

       " ('Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife',\n",
       "  'The Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife is a double-edged fighting knife resembling a dagger or poignard with a foil grip. It was developed by William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric Anthony Sykes in Shanghai based on ideas that the two men had while serving on the Shanghai Municipal Police in China before World War II.[1]\\nThe F-S fighting knife was made famous during World War II when issued to British Commandos, the Airborne Forces, the SAS and many other units, especially for the Normandy landings in June 1944. With its acutely tapered, sharply pointed blade, the F-S fighting knife is frequently described as a stiletto, a weapon optimised for thrusting,[2] although the F-S knife can be used to inflict slash cuts upon an opponent when its cutting edges are sharpened according to specification.[3] The Wilkinson Sword Company made the knife with minor pommel and grip design variations.\\nThe F-S knife is strongly associated with the British commandos and the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Marine Raiders (who based their issued knife on the Fairbairn-Sykes), among other special forces. It features in the insignia of the British 3 Commando Brigade, the Belgian Commandos, the Dutch Commando Corps (founded in the UK during World War II), and of the Australian 1st Commando and 2nd Commando Regiments and United States Army Rangers (all founded with the help of the British Commandos). Large numbers of Fairbairn Sykes knives of varying types, including some with wooden grips, were used by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division that landed on Juno Beach on \"D\" Day and by the men of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. A solid gold F-S fighting knife is part of the commandos\\' memorial at Westminster Abbey.\\nThe first batch of 50 F-S fighting knives was produced in January 1941 by Wilkinson Sword Ltd. Fairbairn and Sykes had travelled to their factory from the Special Training Centre at Lochailort in November 1940 to discuss their ideas for a fighting knife.[4]\\nA batch of 1500 knives of this first pattern was ordered in Nov 1940. An order for 38,000 of the second pattern (slightly revised for wartime exigencies) followed in 1941. By the time of the third pattern of design refinements (dating from October 1943) the knife was being produced by several manufacturers. No formal specification existed until after the war, but the 1949 UK government specification E/1323E remains current.[5]\\nIn December 2019, an SBS commando in Afghanistan used an F-S knife during an ambush by ISIL fighters.[6]\\nThe F-S fighting knife was designed for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade that can easily penetrate a ribcage. Grip is provided by a vase handle, and the blade\\'s slender, sharp-pointed blade is designed for use as a fighting knife. Fairbairn\\'s rationale is in his book Get Tough! (1942).\\nIn close-quarters fighting there is no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.[7]\\nThe Fairbairn-Sykes was produced in several patterns. The Shanghai knife on which it was based was about 5.5\\xa0in (14\\xa0cm) long in the blade. First-pattern knives have a 6.5\\xa0in (17\\xa0cm) blade with a flat area, or ricasso, at the top of the blade under the S-shaped crossguard; this was not present on the original design and its presence has not been explained by the manufacturers. Second-pattern knives have a slightly longer blade (just less than 7\\xa0in (18\\xa0cm)), 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm)-wide oval crossguard, knurled pattern grip, and rounded ball, and may be stamped \"ENGLAND\" (a US legal requirement when importing the surplus knives after WWII) on the handle side of the cross guard. Some may also be stamped with a \"broad arrow\" British issue mark and a number (e.g., 21) on the opposite handle side of the cross guard. Third-pattern knives also have a similarly sized seven-inch blade, but the handle was redesigned to be a ringed grip. This ringed grip is reputed to have disappointed one of the original designers as it unbalanced the weapon and made harder to hold when wet, but it was used by the manufacturers as it was simple to produce and could be cast from a cheaper and more plentiful alloy instead of using up quantities of scarce brass stock. William Rodgers, as part of the Egginton Group, produce an all-black \"sterile\" version of the knife, devoid of any markings showing maker for NATO use.[8]\\nThe length of the blade was chosen to give several inches of blade to penetrate the body after passing through the 3\\xa0in (7.6\\xa0cm) of the thickest clothing expected to be worn in the war, that of Soviet greatcoats.[clarify] Later production runs of the F-S fighting knife have a blade length that is about 7.5\\xa0in (19\\xa0cm).\\nIn all cases the handle had a distinctive foil-like grip to enable a number of handling options. Many variations on the F-S fighting knife exist, in size of blade and particularly of handle. The design has influenced the design of knives throughout the period since its introduction.\\nBecause of the success of the Fairbairn-Sykes knife in World War II and in the wars in Korea and Vietnam, many companies made their own versions of the F-S fighting knife, such as the 1966 Gerber Mark II.\\nAlmost two million of the British knives were made. Early production runs were extremely limited and demand was high, with many British troops attempting to buy their own.\\nThe US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) stiletto was a double-edged knife based on the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife. It was so admired that the US military created several other fighting knives based on it. The OSS\\'s knife manufacturing bid was approximately one-fifteenth of the British equivalent, but the US version of the knife, manufactured by Landers, Frary & Clark, of New Britain, Connecticut, was improperly tempered and inferior to the British F-S fighting knife in materials and workmanship. Its reputation suffered accordingly.[3] A total of 20,000 units of the OSS version were produced. The OSS dagger was officially replaced in service in 1944 by the US M3 fighting knife.[9] The scabbard for the OSS stiletto looks like a pancake spatula, a design that can be worn high or low on the belt, or angled either left or right. In theory this gave a very adaptable mounting system, but the metal belt attachment risked injury to those wearing it, especially parachutists during airborne operations.\\nGeneral Robert T. Frederick of the Devil\\'s Brigade (First Special Service Force) is credited with a similar weapon, the Fighting Commando Knife, Type V-42, better known as the V-42 stiletto, itself a derivation of the F-S design. The V-42 was manufactured by W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co. in the US c.\\u20091942–43 and is distinguished mainly by its markings and the presence of a small, scored indentation for the wielder\\'s thumb, to aid in orienting the knife for thrusting. Fairbairn has been given full or partial credit for the design of several other fighting knives, including the smatchet.\\n'),\n",
       " ('Dirk',\n",
       "  '\\nA dirk is a long-bladed thrusting dagger.[1]  Historically, it gained its name from the Highland dirk (Scottish Gaelic dearg) where it was a personal weapon of officers engaged in naval hand-to-hand combat during the Age of Sail[2] as well as the personal sidearm of Highlanders. It was also the traditional sidearm of the Highland Clansman and later used by the officers, pipers, and drummers of Scottish Highland regiments around 1725 to 1800[1] and by Japanese naval officers.[3]\\nThe term is associated with Scotland in the Early Modern Era, being attested from about 1600. The term was spelled dork or dirk during the 17th century,[4] presumed related to the Danish, Dutch and Swedish dolk, and the German dolch, tolch; from a West Slavic Tillich. The exact etymology is unclear.[5][6][7][8] The modern spelling dirk is probably due to Samuel Johnson\\'s 1755 Dictionary.[9] The term is also used for \"dagger\" generically, especially in the context of prehistoric daggers such as the Oxborough dirk.\\nThe Scottish dirk (also \"Highland dirk\", Scottish Gaelic: biodag), as a symbolic traditional and ceremonial weapon of the Highland Cathairean (cateran or warrior), is worn by officers, pipers and drummers of Scottish Highland regiments. The development of the Scottish dirk as a weapon is unrelated to that of the naval dirk; it is a modern continuation of the 16th-century ballock or rondel dagger.[citation needed]\\nThe traditional Scottish dirk is a probable development from the 16th century but like all medieval societies, the Highlander needed a knife for everyday use. The dirk became symbolic of a Highland man’s honour and oaths were sworn on the steel which was believed to be holy. The following highlights the importance of the dirk in Highland culture:[10]\\nThe dirk occupies a unique niche in Highland culture and history. Many Highland Scots were too cash-poor to buy a sword, following the Disarming Acts enacted to erode Highland martial insurrections but virtually every male carried a dirk—and carried it everywhere! If in Japan the katana was the soul of the Samurai, in Scotland the dirk was the heart of the Highlander. In many warrior cultures oaths were sworn on one\\'s sword. Among the Gael, however, binding oaths with the force of a geas (involving dire supernatural penalties for breaking such an oath) were sworn on one\\'s dirk. The English, aware of this, used the custom against the Highlanders after Culloden: When Highland dress was prohibited in 1747 those Gael who could not read or sign an oath were required to swear a verbal oath, \"in the Irish (Scots Gaelic) tongue and upon the holy iron of their dirks\", not to possess any gun, sword, or pistol, or to use tartan: \"... and if I do so may I be cursed in my undertakings, family and property, may I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without burial in a strange land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this come across me if I break my oath.\"During the period of proscription, only service in a British regiment permitted Highlanders to bear their traditional arms and dress. The 78th Fraser Highlanders, raised in 1757, wore full highland dress uniform;[11] their equipment was described by Major-General James Stewart in 1780 as including a \"musket and broadsword, to which many soldiers added the dirk at their own expense.\"[11][12]\\nAs is well documented in the oral traditions and in almost every title written prior to 1979, the perceived \"holiness\" of the steel is likely to have originated in folk superstitions. These origins are often ascribed to \"magic\" in the forging of Germanic steel. For this reason, it is established that Highlanders retained reverence for blades forged from Solingen steel.[citation needed]\\nThe modern development of the Scottish dirk into a ceremonial weapon occurred during the 19th century.[citation needed]  The shape of the grip developed from the historical more cylindrical form to a shape intended to represent the thistle. Fancier fittings, often of silver, became popular shortly after 1800. The hilts of modern Scottish dirks are often carved from dark colored wood such as bog oak or ebony.[citation needed] Hilts and scabbards are often lavishly decorated with silver mounts and have pommels set with cairngorm stones.[citation needed] The blades measure 12\\xa0in (300\\xa0mm) in length and are single edged with decorative file work known as \"jimping\" on the unsharpened back edge of the blade.[13] When worn, the dirk normally hangs by a leather strap known as a \"frog\" from a dirk belt, which is a wide leather belt having a large, usually ornate buckle, that is worn around the waist with a kilt.[14]  Many Scottish dirks carry a smaller knife and fork which fit into compartments on the front of the sheath,[15] and a smaller knife known as a sgian dubh is also worn tucked into the top of the hose when wearing a kilt.[16]\\nA thrusting weapon, the naval dirk originally functioned as a boarding weapon and as a functional fighting dagger.[2]  During the days of sail, midshipmen and officers wore dirks; the daggers gradually evolved into ceremonial weapons and badges of office.[2]  In the Royal Navy, the naval dirk is still presented to junior officers; the basic design of the weapon has changed little in the last 500 years.[2]\\nThe naval dirk (Polish: kordzik, Russian: кортик) became part of the uniform of naval officers and civilian officials in the Navy Ministry of the Russian Empire, and in the Soviet navy an element of the dress uniform of officers.[citation needed]  Later, it became an element of other uniforms as well, e.g. of officers in the Russian and Polish army and air force and of the police forces in some[which?] countries.[clarification needed][citation needed]\\nIn the United States, the dirk was introduced by Scottish immigrants in the 1700s.  This was originally a single-edged weapon, but by 1745 more commonly had a double-edged blade making the dirk more or less synonymous with the dagger.  Dirks were often made from old sword blades.  In the nineteenth centuries dirks started to be made with a curved blade, but returned to a straight blade by the end of the century.  Some were long enough to be considered a short sword.[17]\\n'),\n",

       "  'The kris or keris[n 1] is an Javanese asymmetrical dagger with distinctive blade-patterning achieved through alternating laminations of iron and nickelous iron (pamor).[8] The kris is famous for its distinctive wavy blade, although many have straight blades as well, and is one of the weapons commonly used in then pencak silat martial art native to Indonesia. Kris have been produced in many regions of Indonesia for centuries, but nowhere—although the island of Bali comes close—is the kris so embedded in a mutually-connected whole of ritual prescriptions and acts, ceremonies, mythical backgrounds and epic poetry as in Central Java.[9]:\\u200a27\\u200a Within Indonesia the kris is commonly associated with Javanese culture, although other ethnicities are familiar with the weapon as part of their culture, such as the Balinese, Sundanese, Malay, Madurese, Banjar, Buginese, and Makassar people. Abroad, the kris is considered as a cultural symbol of Indonesia.[2]:\\u200a266\\u200a\\nA kris can be divided into three parts: blade (bilah or wilah), hilt (hulu), and sheath (warangka). Each part of the kris is considered a piece of art, often carved in meticulous detail and made from various materials: metal, precious or rare types of wood, or gold or ivory. A kris\\'s aesthetic value covers the dhapur (the form and design of the blade, with around 60 variants), the pamor (the pattern of metal alloy decoration on the blade, with around 250 variants), and tangguh referring to the age and origin of a kris.[10] Depending on the quality and historical value of the kris, it can fetch thousands of dollars or more.\\nBoth a weapon and spiritual object, kris are often considered to have an essence or presence, considered to possess magical powers, with some blades possessing good luck and others possessing bad.[10] Kris are used for display, as talismans with magical powers, weapons, a sanctified heirloom (pusaka), auxiliary equipment for court soldiers, an accessory for ceremonial dress, an indicator of social status, a symbol of heroism, etc.[10] Legendary kris that possess supernatural power and extraordinary ability were mentioned in traditional folktales, such as those of Empu Gandring, Taming Sari, and Setan Kober.\\nIn 2005, UNESCO awarded the kris the status of Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.[10]\\nThe word kris come from the Old Javanese term \"kris\" (Javanese: ꦏꦿꦶꦱ꧀) which means \"dagger\".[11] In Javanese, kris is known as kris (Javanese: ꦏꦿꦶꦱ꧀), dhuwung (Javanese: ꦝꦸꦮꦸꦁ), and wangkingan (Javanese: ꦮꦁꦏꦶꦁꦔꦤ꧀).[11] In Malay (subsequently Indonesian[12] and Malaysian[13]), Sundanese, Balinese and Sasak it is spelled keris (Pegon and Jawi: کريس). Other names include karih in Minangkabau, and sele (ᨔᨙᨒᨙ) in Buginese and Makassarese.\\nTwo notable exceptions are the Philippines where it is usually called kalis in Tagalog, although the Filipino kalis is more like a sword rather than a dagger, and Thailand where it is always spelled kris and pronounced either as kris or krit (กริช) in Thai, while in the Yala dialect it is spelled kareh. In Cambodia it is spelled as kris (គ្រីស) in Khmer. Other alternative spellings used by Europeans include \"cryse\", \"crise\", \"criss\", \"kriss\" and \"creese\". In English, the plural form is often simply \"kris\" as well.\\nThe Kris\\'s history is generally traced through the study of carvings and bas-relief panels found in Java, Indonesia. Some of the most famous renderings of a kris appear on the bas-reliefs of Borobudur (825) and Prambanan temple (850), originated from Hindu-Buddhist Mataram Kingdom of Central Java.\\nThe term kris was mentioned in several ancient Javanese inscriptions, including Humanding inscription (707 Saka or 875 CE), Jurungan inscription and Haliwangbang inscription (708 Saka or 876 CE), Taji inscription (823 Saka or 901 CE), Poh inscription (827 Saka or 905 CE), and Rukam inscription (829 Saka or 907 CE).[2]:\\u200a266\\u200a\\nThe description of a small dagger from Java reminiscent of kris can be found in Chinese source from the 10th century Song dynasty. In 992 the envoy from She-po (Java) arrived in Chinese court bearing a lot of gifts, consists of a dagger with exquisite hilt made of rhino horn and gold, silk woven with floral motifs made of gold threads, ivories, pearls, silk of various colours, fragrant sandalwood, cotton clothes of various colours, turtle shells, betel nut preparation kit, rattan mat with the image of white cockatoo, and a small model of house made of sandalwood adorned with valuable ornaments.[14]:\\u200a199\\u200a\\nHowever, Raffles\\' (1817) study of the Candi Sukuh states that the kris recognized today came into existence around 1361 AD in the kingdom of Majapahit, East Java. The scene in bas relief of Sukuh Temple in Central Java, dated from 15th century Majapahit era, shows the workshop of a Javanese keris blacksmith.[citation needed] The scene depicted Bhima as the blacksmith on the left forging the metal, Ganesha in the center, and Arjuna on the right operating the piston bellows to blow air into the furnace. The wall behind the blacksmith displays various items manufactured in the forge, including kris. These representations of the kris in the Candi Sukuh established the fact that by the year 1437 the kris had already gained an important place within Javanese culture.\\nIn Yingya Shenglan—a record about Zheng He\\'s expedition (1405–1433)—Ma Huan describes that\\nall men in Majapahit, from the king to commoners, from a boy aged three to elders, slipped pu-la-t\\'ou (belati or more precisely kris dagger) in their belts. The daggers are made entirely of steel with intricate motifs smoothly drawn. The handles are made of gold, rhino\\'s horn or ivory carved with a depiction of human or demon; the carving works are exquisite and skillfully made.[15]This Chinese account also reported that public execution by stabbing using this type of dagger is common. Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men\\'s hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them for a few paces, and then stabbed the offender one or two times in the back on the gap between the floating ribs, which resulted in severe bleeding and instant death.\\nCurrently, the Kris of Knaud is the oldest known surviving kris in the world.[16] Given to Charles Knaud, a Dutch physician, by Paku Alam V in the 19th century Yogyakarta in Java, the kris is on display at the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam. The kris bears the date of 1264 Saka (which corresponds to 1342 AD) in its iron blade. Scientists suspect that due to its special features the kris might be even older, but was decorated during Majapahit period to celebrate an important event.[17] The kris bears scenes from the Ramayana on an unusual thin copper layer which partially covers it.\\nAlthough the people of Southeast Asia were already familiar with this type of stabbing weapon, the development of the kris most probably took place in Java, Indonesia. From its origin in Java, the use of kris spread throughout the Indonesian archipelago, Singapore, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and the Philippines through diplomacy and trade.[2]:\\u200a267\\u200a The spread of the kris to other nations such as Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, some historians say, was credited to the growing influence of the Majapahit Empire in Java around the year 1492.[8]\\nThe Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian canto XVII, a Sundanese manuscript dated from Saka 1440 or 1518 AD, describes the kris as the weapon of kings, while the kujang is the weapon of farmers. There exist claims of earlier forms predating the Majapahit kris but none are verifiable. In the past, the majority of kris had straight blades but this became less frequent over time. Tomé Pires, in the early 16th century, describes the importance of the kris to the Javanese.[3]\\nWhile it is commonly believed that kris were the primary weapons wielded by fighters in the past, they were actually carried by warriors as a secondary armament if they lost their main weapon, which was usually a spear. For commoners however, kris were worn on a daily basis, especially when travelling because it might be needed for self-defense. During times of peace, people wore kris as part of ceremonial attire. Ceremonial kris were often meticulously decorated with intricate carving in gold and precious stones. Heirloom blades were handed down through successive generations and worn during special events such as weddings and other ceremonies. Men usually wore only one kris but the admiral Hang Tuah is said in the Hikayat Hang Tuah to have armed himself with one short and one long kris. Women also wore kris, though usually of a smaller size than a man\\'s. In battle, a fighter might have carried more than one kris; some carried three kris: his own, one from his father-in-law, and one as a family heirloom. The extra two served as parrying daggers, but if none were available the sheath would serve the same purpose.\\nKris were often broken in battle and required repairs. Yearly cleanings, known in Javanese tradition as jamasan, is required as part of the spirituality and mythology surrounding the weapon, often left ancient blades worn and thin. The repair materials depended on location and it is quite usual to find a weapon with fittings from several areas. For example, a kris may have a blade from Java, a hilt from Bali and a sheath from Madura.\\n... every man in Java, whether he is rich or poor, must have a kris in his house ... and no man between the ages of 12 and 80 may go out of doors without a kris in his belt. They carry them at the back, as daggers used to be in Portugal ...In many parts of Indonesia and the Malacca Sultanate, the kris used to be the choice weapon for an execution known as the hukuman salang. The executioner\\'s kris had a long, straight, slender blade. The condemned knelt before the executioner, who placed a wad of cotton or similar material on the subject\\'s shoulder or clavicle area. The blade was thrust through the padding, piercing the subclavian artery and the heart. Upon withdrawal, the cotton wiped the blade clean.[18]:\\u200a37\\u200a In the Malay world and Java, an honourable form of execution was death by kris to the heart.[19]:\\u200a141\\u200a\\nKris were used commonly in battle, during the early modern period, instead of having professional armies, most kings within the region relied on their courtiers to mobilize for war whenever required and since most Javanese, Malay and Makassarese would own a kris, the weapon would have seen regular combat.[19]:\\u200a127\\u200a During amok, the kris was used in a furious charge to scatter or kill a number of enemies even at the cost of one\\'s own life.[19]:\\u200a125\\u200a\\nIn the 16th century, European colonial powers introduced firearms into the archipelago that contributed to the decline of using the kris as the weapon of choice in battle. The forging of edged weapons went into decline from the moment that the sultans or rajas were subjugated and their realms annexed by the British or Dutch East Indies colonial state. In number of regions, a ban was placed on carrying of cutting and stabbing weapons.\\nIn Java, the turning point was the end of the five-year-long Java War when the rebellious Prince Diponegoro was defeated and detained, and had to hand his kris over to the Dutch in 1830. This event marked the disarmament of the kris as a combat weapon among the Javanese populace. Its ceremonial function, however, as part of traditional costumes, as sacred heirloom and as a protective personal amulet, remains.\\nHowever, the kris saw continuous use and forging in the Philippines, which comprised most of the Spanish East Indies. Kris-forgers and swordsmen were referred to as juramentados by the Spanish. Juramentados practice a ritual of sacrifice, a form of Jihad against not only Spanish soldiers, but also against Christian Filipinos alike.\\nThe early 20th century saw the decline of kris forging as carrying edged weapons was banned in the Dutch East Indies.[9]:\\u200a30\\u200a However its spiritual and ceremonial function still continues and is celebrated mainly in kraton and istana (courts) throughout Indonesia, Malaysia and the Muslim-inhabited parts of the southern Philippines.\\nIn Java, the traditional art of kris-making is preserved in the Javanese culture heartland, the keraton (royal court) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, and also the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman. The Javanese kings and nobles of these courts are known to employ some kris blacksmiths (empu) and become the patrons of their works, although the activity of kris-making is declining. Until the 1990s, kris-making activities in Java had almost come to a standstill due to economic difficulties and changing socio-cultural values. However, thanks to several concerned kris experts, the tradition is being revived and kris craftsmanship has increased again.\\nOver the past three decades, kris have lost their prominent social and spiritual meaning in society. Although active and honoured smiths who produce high quality kris in the traditional way can still be found in some places such as Madura, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Makassar and Palembang, their number is dramatically decreasing, and it is more difficult for them to find successors to whom they may transmit their skills.[10] The traditional kris-making industry still survives in some villages, such as Banyu Sumurup village in Imogiri subdistrict, Bantul, Yogyakarta, either specially made as a sacred amulet ordered by a kris enthusiast who seeks its spiritual power, or merely as souvenirs for tourists.[20]\\nPhysically, the kris is a form of dagger with a blade measuring between 15 and 50\\xa0in (38 and 127\\xa0cm) long, sharp on both edges and tip, broader and asymmetric shape near the hilt, made of a combination of several kinds of metals.[2]:\\u200a267\\u200a A kris\\'s aesthetic value covers the dhapur (the form and design of the blade, with around 150 variants), the pamor (the pattern of metal alloy decoration on the blade, with around 60 variants), and tangguh referring to the age and origin of a kris.[10]\\nThe kris blade is called a wilah or bilah. Kris blades are usually narrow with a wide, asymmetrical base. The kris is famous for its wavy blade; however, the older types of kris dated from the Majapahit era have straight blades,[21] as do more than half of all kris prior to the modern era.[22] The number of curves on the blade (known as luk or lok) is always odd.[23] Common numbers of luk range from three to thirteen waves, but some blades have up to 29.[24] In contrast to the older straight type, most kris today have a wavy blade which is supposed to increase the severity of wounds inflicted upon a victim.[23]\\nAccording to traditional Javanese kejawen, kris contain all the intrinsic elements of nature: tirta (water), bayu (wind), agni (fire), bantolo (earth, but also interpreted as metal or wood which both come from the earth), and aku (lit: \"I\" or \"me\", meaning that the kris has a spirit or soul). All these elements are present during the forging of kris. Earth is metal forged by fire being blown by pumped wind, and water to cool down the metal.[25] In Bali, the kris is associated with the nāga or dragon, which also symbolizes irrigation canals, rivers, springs, wells, spouts, waterfalls and rainbows; thus, the wavy blade symbolizes the movement of the serpent. Some kris have the head of a naga (dragon) carved near the base with the body and tail following the curves of the blade to the tip. A wavy kris is thus a naga in motion, aggressive and alive; a straight blade is one at rest, its power dormant but ready to come into action.[26]\\nIn former times, kris blades were said to be infused with poison during their forging, ensuring that any injury was fatal. The poison used to polish kris blade is called warangan.[27] The process of chemical coating was done by warangan or jamas (washing) the blade with acid and minerals that contains arsenic compounds.[28] The process of doing so was kept secret among smiths. Different types of whetstones, acidic juice of citrus fruits and poisonous arsenic bring out the contrast between the dark black iron and the light colored silvery nickel layers which together form pamor, damascene patterns on the blade.\\nThe distinctive pamor patterns have specific meanings and names which indicate the mythical properties they are believed to impart. There are around 60 variants of pamor recognized today in traditional kris blades. Some examples of pamor include beras wutah, udan mas, kembang kacang, kembang pala and ladrang cendan. The kris blade forging uses iron with a small content of nickel to create this pattern. The faint pamor pattern has been found in the kris from Majapahit period, which was acquired from iron ores with small nickel content. Most probably this iron ore was imported from the island of Sulawesi, as the pamor Luwu from Luwu region is quite well known in Sulawesi and Java.\\nThe best material for creating pamor however, is acquired in a quite unusual way, as it is made from rare meteorite iron. Traditionally the pamor material for the kris smiths connected with the courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta originates from an iron meteorite that fell to earth at the end of 18th century in the neighborhood of the Prambanan temple complex. The meteorite was excavated and transported to the keraton of Surakarta; from that time on the smiths of Vorstenlanden (the Royal territories) used small pieces of meteoric iron to produce pamor patterns in their kris, pikes, and other status weapons. After etching the blade with acidic substances, it is the small percentage of nickel present in meteoric iron that creates the distinctive silvery patterns that faintly light up against the dark background of iron or steel that become darkened by the effect of the acids.[9]:\\u200a19\\u200a\\nThe handle or hilt (hulu) is an object of art, often carved in meticulous details and made from various materials: precious rare types of wood to gold or ivory. They were often carved to resemble various animals and Hindu deities, although this became less common with the introduction of Islam. In Bali, kris handles are made to resemble demons coated in gold and adorned with semi precious and precious stones, such as rubies. In Java, kris handles are made in various types, the most common design being the abstract stylized representation of the human form. Examples of hilt designs include Tunggak Semi Putri Kinurung hilt from Surakarta, Batara Guru and Pulasir hilt from Madura, Punukan hilt from Palembang, Ratmaja from Bali, Pulungan hilt from Cirebon, Pekaka hilt from Pattani, and a seabird-like hilt from Lampung and Sulawesi.[29] The kris usually has a curved pistol-grip hilt that aids in stabbing strikes. It allows the palm of the holding hand to add pressure to the blade while stabbing. A kris only offers minimal protection for the hand by the broad blade at the hilt.\\nAs with the hilt, a kris\\' sheath (warangka) is also an object of art. It can be made from various materials, usually a wooden frame to hold the blade which can be coated with metals such as brass, iron, silver, or even gold, usually carved in sulur floral motifs. The upper part of the sheath formed a broad curved handle made from wood or sometimes ivory. It could be adorned with precious or semi-precious stones.\\nThe making of a kris was the specialised duty of metalworkers called empu (lit. \"possessor\") or pandai besi (lit. \"iron-skilled\"). In Java the honorary title empu refer to those ironsmiths who possess the special skill of forging the kris. According to Javanese beliefs, a kris empu should possess knowledge, technical skills and also spiritual prowess, since kris are believed to have physical and spiritual presence.[30] This was meant to differentiate the masters from common pandai besi that mostly create common metal tools or peasant\\'s weapons like parang or golok. In old Majapahit, a kris bladesmith was referred to as pande and all were reputed to be able to work hot iron with their bare hands. The people of Majapahit would eventually flee to Bali where the occupation has been preserved by the Pande clan to this day, members of whom also make jewellery. A bladesmith makes the blade in layers of different iron ores and meteorite nickel. Some blades can be made in a relatively short time, while more intricate weapons take years to complete. In high quality kris blades, the metal is folded dozens or hundreds of times and handled with the utmost precision. Empu are highly respected craftsmen with additional knowledge in literature, history, and the occult.[10]\\nKris were worn at special ceremonies, with heirloom blades being handed down through successive generations. Both men and women might wear them, though those for women are smaller. A rich spirituality and mythology developed around the weapon. Kris are used for display, as talismans with magical powers, weapons, sanctified heirloom, auxiliary equipment for court soldiers, as an accessory for ceremonial dress, an indicator of social status, a symbol of heroism, etc.[10]\\nIn the Barong dance of Bali there is a segment called keris dance, in which the villain Rangda magically enchants Airlangga\\'s soldiers to commit suicide, while another magician makes them invulnerable to sharp objects. In a trance state, the male dancers stab themselves in the chest with their own kris but remain unhurt.[31]\\nThe kris dance is a potentially dangerous dance and can lead to  fatal accidents. In February 2021, a 16 year old kris dancer was stabbed to death in his heart by his own kris, during a Rangda dance performance in Denpasar, Bali.[32]\\nIn Javanese culture the kris is revered as tosan aji (Javanese for \"sacred heirloom weapon\") and considered a pusaka. The kris is believed to have the ability to infuse bravery upon its holder: this property is known as piyandel in Javanese which means \"to add self-confidence\". The pusaka kris or kris-tipped spear given by a Javanese king to nobles or his subjects, was meant to symbolize the king\\'s confidence bestowed upon the receiver and is considered a great honor. During the Javanese wedding ceremony, a kris is required to be adorned with chains of jasmine flower arrangement as an important part of Javanese groom\\'s wedding costume. The addition of jasmine arrangement around the kris was meant as a symbol that a man should not easily be angry, cruel, fierce, too aggressive, tyrannical and abusive.[24]\\nKris-makers did more than forge the weapon, they carried out the old rituals which could infuse the blade with mystical powers. For this reason, kris are considered almost alive because they may be vessels of spirits, either good or evil. Legends tell of kris that could move of their own volition and killed individuals at will. Some kris are rumored to stand upright when their real names are called by their masters. It was said that some kris helped prevent fires, death, agricultural failure, and many other problems. Likewise, they could also bring fortune, such as bountiful harvests. Many of these beliefs were derived from the possession of different kris by different people. For example, there is a type of kris in Java that was called Beras Wutah, which was believed to grant its possessor an easy life without famine. This kris was mainly assigned to government officers who were paid, in whole or in part, with foodstuffs such as rice.\\nThere are several ways of testing whether a kris is lucky or not. A series of cuts on a leaf, based on blade width and other factors, could determine if a blade was good or bad. Also, if the owner slept with the blade under their pillow, the spirit of the kris would communicate with the owner via dream. If the owner had a bad dream, the blade was unlucky and had to be discarded, whereas if the owner had a good dream the dagger would bring good fortune. However, just because a blade was bad for one person didn\\'t mean it would be bad for another. Harmony between the weapon and its owner was critical.\\nBecause some kris are considered sacred and believed to possess magical powers, specific rites needed to be completed to avoid calling down evil fates which is the reason warriors often made offerings to their kris at a shrine. There is also the belief that pointing a kris at someone means they will die soon, so silat practitioners precede their demonstrations by touching the points of the blades to the ground so as to neutralise this effect.\\nSeveral folktales—linked to historical figures—mention legendary kris that possess supernatural power and extraordinary ability. Most of the magical kris are of Javanese origin, while the tales are mainly derived from Javanese ancient manuscript and Babad (Javanese chronicle).\\nOne of the most famous legends from Java comes from the Pararaton (Book of Kings). It describes a legendary bladesmith called Mpu Gandring or Empu Gandring and his impatient customer, Ken Arok, in the last days of the Kediri kingdom in the 13th century. The customer ordered a powerful kris to kill the mighty chieftain of Tumapel, Tunggul Ametung. Ken Arok eventually stabbed the old bladesmith to death because he kept delaying the scheduled completion of the kris. Dying, the bladesmith cursed the kris through prophecy that the unfinished or incomplete kris would kill seven men, including Ken Arok. Ken Arok used Mpu Gandring\\'s cursed kris to assassinate Tunggul Ametung, cunningly put the blame to Kebo Ijo, and built a new kingdom of Singhasari. The prophecy finally came true, with four men enlisted as the kris\\' first death roll, including Mpu Gandring himself, Tunggul Ametung, Kebo Ijo to whom Ken Arok lent the weapon, and finally Ken Arok himself. The unfinished kris then disappeared.[33][34]\\nAnother version of the tale describes that the kris passed to Ken Arok\\'s stepson Anusapati which in turn killed his stepfather after recognized that his biological father was killed by Ken Arok with the same kris. The bloody feud continued on and on until the reign of Kertanegara, the last king of Singosari Empire\\nTaming Sari (\"flower shield\") is one of the most well-known kris in Malay literature, said to be so skilfully crafted that anyone wielding it was unbeatable. In some versions of the legend, the weapon would grant its user physical invulnerability. The legend took place sometime during the fall of Majapahit Empire and the rise of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century. Tun Sri Lanang\\'s book, the Sejarah Melayu, tells that it was made by a Javanese empu and first used by the champion of Majapahit, a pendekar named Taming Sari. He was defeated in a duel to the death by the Melakan admiral Hang Tuah, after which the king of Majapahit presented the weapon to the victor.[35]\\nAfter being framed by a jealous official, Hang Tuah was ordered to be executed, but he managed to escape and go into hiding with the help of a minister who knew the truth. Hang Tuah\\'s kris and title of Laksamana (admiral) were passed on to his comrade Hang Jebat. Furious that his best friend was unfairly put to death, Hang Jebat rebelled against the royalty and took over the palace. The desperate ruler of Melaka pardoned the minister so long as Hang Tuah could win him back the throne. Having trained under the same master since childhood the two friends were nearly equals but of the two, Tuah was the superior fighter. However, even after a long battle in the palace, neither could best the other because the Kris Taming Sari evened the odds. Only after taking his weapon back did Hang Tuah manage to stab Jebat, who died soon after.\\nJavanese folk story tells of Arya Penangsang, the mighty viceroy (adipati) of Jipang who was killed by his own kris called Setan Kober (\"devil of the grave\"). It was forged by Empu Bayu Aji in the kingdom of Pajajaran, and had 13 luk on its blade. Near its completion when the empu tried to infuse the weapon with spiritual power, he was disturbed by a crying demon (djinn) from the graveyard. As a result, although powerful, the kris had a temperamental evil nature that caused the wielder to be overly ambitious and impatient.\\nThe story took place in the 16th century, during the fall of Demak Sultanate that had replaced Majapahit as the ruler of Java. Setan Kober was safely kept by Sunan Kudus, one of the nine Islamic saints of Java. However Sunan Prawoto, son of Prince Trenggana and grandson of Raden Patah, stole it and used it to assassinate his uncle Raden Kikin by the river. Since then, Raden Kikin is also referred to as Sekar Seda Lepen (flower that fell by the river). Raden Trenggana rose as a sultan and later after his death, was replaced by Sunan Prawoto. Kikin\\'s son, Penangsang of Jipang with the help of his teacher, Sunan Kudus, took revenge by sending an assassin to kill Prawoto using the Setan Kober kris. Prawoto younger sister Ratu Kalinyamat seeks revenge on Penangsang, since Penangsang also murdered her husband. She urged her brother in-law, Hadiwijaya (Joko Tingkir) the ruler of Pajang, to kill Arya Penangsang. Hadiwijaya sent his adopted son and also his son in-law Sutawijaya, who would later become the first ruler of the Mataram dynasty.\\nDuring a battle, Sutawijaya stabbed Penangsang with the Kyai Plered spear in the gut. However, Penangsang was believed to possess aji or kesaktian (spiritual power), he kept fighting with an open wound in the stomach. He encircled his hanging intestines on his kris hilt, and continued to fight. When trying to attack his opponent, the reckless, fierce and impatient Panangsang pulled his Setan Kober off its sheath, but accidentally cut his own intestines and died.\\nThe Javanese tradition of putting jasmine garlands around the kris hilt, especially on groom\\'s kris during the wedding ceremony, is said to originate from this tale. It is to symbolize that the groom should not be reckless, easily get angry, impatient and abusive like Arya Panangsang.[24] To replace the intestine, the kris is coiled with a floral garland of jasmine chain that resemble intestine. The jasmine is to symbolize sacredness, patience, grace, humility, kindness and benevolence, the qualities lack in Panangsang. However another source mentioned that actually Sutawijaya admired Penangsang\\'s fighting spirits, still fighting although his intestine encircled around his kris. Impressed by Penangsang\\'s deed, later he command his male descendants to follow his step, adorned the kris with \"intestine\" made from the chain of jasmine, as a symbol of bravery. The story of Arya Penangsang has inspired and performed as Javanese ketoprak drama.[36]\\nDuring the Royal Netherlands state visit to Indonesia in March 2020, King Willem-Alexander returned the kris of Prince Diponegoro to \\nIndonesia, received by President Joko Widodo. Today considered as Indonesian national hero, Prince Diponegoro of Yogyakarta was the charismatic leader of the mass rebellion against Dutch colonial rule in Central Java, that was defeated and taken prisoner after the conclusion of Java War in 1830.[37] His kris was long considered lost, but has now been found, after being identified by the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The kris of Prince Diponegoro represents a historic importance, as a symbol of Indonesian heroic resilience and the nation\\'s struggle for independence. The extraordinary gold-inlaid Javanese dagger previously was held as the Dutch state collection, and is now part of the collection of the Indonesian National Museum.[38] There is great doubt whether the Kris is the original Kris of Dipenegoro. Experts think not.[39]\\nThroughout the archipelago, the kris is a symbol of heroism,[10] martial prowess, power and authority. As a cultural symbol, the meticulously decorated kris represent refinement, art and beauty, as the pride and prized possession for its owner;[24] however, as a weapon it is associated with violence, death and bloodshed. Probably for this reason, although the kris is widespread in Javanese culture, it is not used to symbolise Javanese culture or royalty, as Javanese tradition promotes harmony and discourages direct confrontation (hence the absence of knives on Indonesian dinner tables). This is also why the Javanese traditionally wear the kris on their back, to symbolize violence as the last resort. Balinese and Sundanese also wearing kris on their back. However, in other parts of archipelago, from Sumatra to the Malay Peninsula and to Sulawesi, the kris is worn on the front or left side on the hip.\\nThe kris is depicted on different flags, emblems, coats and logos such as those of the Mataram Sultanate, Riau Islands Province, Terengganu and Selangor. The former emblem of Siam uses the kris to represent the southern territories. It can also be seen on an obverse copper-zinc-tin RM1 coin with a songket pattern in the background. The Malaya and British Borneo dollar 1 cent coin of 1962 also depicted a pair of crossed kris.\\nSince the independence of Malaysia, the kris has become a symbol of Malay nationalism, particularly of ketuanan Melayu, the doctrine of the Malay race as the dominant race at their homeland. It has been incorporated into the Sang Saka Bangsa, the official flag of the United Malays National Organisation.[40]\\nIn the Philippines, the kalis , a larger sword variant of the kris, is a symbol of Moro and southern Filipino culture, and a resistance to Spanish rule and influence. It is incorporated into the flags of the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. It has also been incorporated into the flag of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, historical flags of the Sultanate of Sulu, as well as the emblem of the Cotabato Province.\\nWayang (2008)\\nKeris (2008)\\nBatik (2009)\\nAngklung (2010)\\nPinisi, art of boatbuilding in South Sulawesi (2017)\\nThree Genres of Traditional Dance in Bali (2019)\\nPencak silat (2019)\\nPantun (2020)\\nGamelan (2021)\\nNoken (2011)\\nSaman dance (2012)\\n'),\n",
       " ('Seax',\n",
       "  'Seax (Old English pronunciation: [ˈsæɑks]; also sax, sæx, sex; invariant in plural, latinized sachsum) is an Old English word for \"knife\".[1]  In modern archaeology, the term seax is used specifically for a type of small sword, knife or dagger typical of the Germanic peoples of the Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages, especially the Saxons. These vary considerably in size.\\nIn heraldry, the seax is a charge consisting of a curved sword with a notched blade, appearing, for example, in the coats of arms of Essex and the former Middlesex.[2]\\nOld English seax and Old Frisian sax are identical with Old Saxon and Old High German sahs, all from a Common Germanic *sahsą from a root *sah, *sag- \"to cut\" (also in saw, from a PIE root *sek-). In Scandinavia, the words sax, saks or sakset all refer to scissors, which are used for cutting various materials.\\nThe term scramaseax or scramsax (lit. \"wounding-knife\") is sometimes used for disambiguation, even though it is not attested in Old English, but taken from an occurrence of scramasaxi  in Gregory of Tours\\' History of the Franks.[3]\\nThe name of the roofer\\'s tool, the zax, is a development from this word.[4]\\nAmongst the shape and construction of seaxes there is a great deal of variation. The most frequent characteristics are:\\nIn the continental Germanic area, the following types are defined for seaxes between roughly 450 and 800 AD, in chronological order:[5]\\nThe general trend, as one moves from the short to the broad seax, is that the blade becomes heavier, longer, broader and thicker. Long seaxes, which arrived at the end of the seventh century, were the longest of the seax. These were narrower and lighter than their predecessors. Initially, these weapons were found in combination with double-edged swords and were probably intended as side arm. From the seventh century onwards, seaxes became the main edged weapon (next to a francisca), sometimes in combination with small side-knives.[5]\\nThe rest of Europe (except for parts of Scandinavia) followed a similar development, although some types may not be very common depending on location. In England long seaxes appear later than on the continent and finds of long seaxes (as opposed to knives) remain very rare in comparison to finds of swords throughout the period.[6][7]\\nAnother typical form of the seax is the so-called broken-back style seax. These seaxes have a sharp angled transition between the back section of the blade and the point, the latter generally forming 1/3 to 3/5 of the blade length, exactly like a large version of a modern clip-point blade. These seaxes exist both in long seax variety (edge and back parallel) and in smaller blades of various lengths (blade expanding first, then narrowing towards the tip after the kink). They occurred mostly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with some examples in Germany around the eighth to eleventh century. Some examples have pattern welded blades, while others have inlays of silver, copper, brass, etc.\\n'),\n",

       " ('Kirpan',\n",
       "  '\\nThe kirpan (pronunciation: [kɪɾpaːn])  is a curved, single-edged blade that Khalsa Sikhs are required to wear as part of their religious uniform (The 5 Ks), as prescribed by the Sikh Code of Conduct.[1] Traditionally, the kirpan was a full-sized talwar sword around 76 cm (30 inches) in length;[2] however, British colonial policies and laws introduced in the 19th century reduced the length of the blade,[3][4][5] and in the modern day, the kirpan is typically manifested as a dagger or knife. According to the Sikh Rehat Maryada, \"The length of the sword to be worn is not prescribed\".[6] It is part of a religious commandment given by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699, founding the Khalsa order and introducing the five articles of faith (the five Ks) which must be worn at all times, the kirpan being one of five Ks.[7][8]\\nThe Punjabi word ਕਿਰਪਾਨ, kirpān, has a folk etymology with two roots: kirpa, meaning \"mercy\", \"grace\", \"compassion\" or \"kindness\"; and aanaa, meaning \"honor\", \"grace\" or \"dignity\". It is derived from or related to Sanskrit कृपाण (kṛpāṇa, “sword, dagger, sacrificial knife”), ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European stem *kerp-, from *(s)ker, meaning \"to cut\".\\nSikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a Sant Sipahi or \"saint-soldier\", showing no fear on the battlefield and treating defeated enemies humanely. The Bhagat further defines the qualities of a sant sipahi as one who is \"truly brave...who fights for the deprived\".[9]\\nKirpans are curved and have a single cutting edge that can be sharp or blunt,[5] which is up to the religious convictions of the wearer.[10] They vary in size and a Sikh who has undergone the Amrit Sanskar ceremony of initiation may carry more than one; the Kirpans must be made of steel or iron.[11]\\nThe Kirpan represents bhagauti, meaning “primal divine power”.[12]\\nSikhism was founded in the 15th century in the Punjab region of Early-Modern India. At the time of its founding, this culturally rich region was governed by the Mughal Empire. During the time of the founder of the Sikh faith and its first guru, Guru Nanak, Sikhism flourished as a counter to both the prevalent Hindu and Muslim teachings. The Mughal emperor Akbar focused on religious tolerance. His relationship with the Sikh Gurus was cordial.[13]\\nThe relationship between the Sikhs and Akbar\\'s successor Jahangir was not friendly. Later Mughal rulers reinstated shari\\'a traditions of jizya, a poll tax on non-Muslims. The Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth guru, refused to remove references to Muslim and Hindu teachings in the Adi Granth and was summoned and executed.[14]\\nThis incident is seen as a turning point in Sikh history,[15] leading to the first instance of militarization of Sikhs under Guru Arjan Dev\\'s son Guru Hargobind. Guru Arjan Dev explained to the five Sikhs who accompanied him to Lahore, that Guru Hargobind has to build a defensive army to protect the people. Guru Hargobind trained in shashtar vidya, a form of martial arts that became prevalent among the Sikhs. He first conceptualized the idea of the kirpan through the notion of Sant Sipahi, or \"saint soldiers\".\\nThe relationship between the Sikhs and the Mughals further deteriorated following the execution of the ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur by Aurengzeb, who was highly intolerant of Sikhs, partially driven by his desire to impose Islamic law. Following the executions of their leaders and facing increasing persecution, the Sikhs officially adopted militarization for self-protection by creating later on the Khalsa; the executions also prompted formalization of various aspects of the Sikh faith. The tenth and final guru, Guru Gobind Singh formally included the kirpan as a mandatory article of faith for all baptised Sikhs,[16] making it a duty for Sikhs to be able to defend the needy, suppressed ones, to defend righteousness and the freedom of expression.\\nIn modern times there has been debate about allowing Sikhs to carry a kirpan that falls under prohibitions on bladed weapons, with some countries allowing Sikhs a dispensation.\\nOther issues not strictly of legality arise, such as whether to allow carrying of kirpans on commercial aircraft or into areas where security is enforced.\\nIn May 2021, the state of New South Wales imposed a ban on bringing any knives, including kirpans, onto school grounds after a 14-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old boy with his kirpan in a school in Sydney\\'s north-west on 6 May.[17] After members of Sydney\\'s Sikh community spoke out and defended their children\\'s rights to bring religious items to school,[18] the state\\'s Department of Education reversed this decision in August 2021 and implemented new guidelines around the bringing of kirpans with the following conditions:[19]\\nIn August 2023, the state of Queensland repealed a previous ban on bringing knives to schools and other public places after Australian Sikh Kamaljit Kaur Athwal took the Queensland state government to court in 2022. The Supreme Court of Queensland found that the ban, which was stated in section 55 of the Weapons Act 1990 (Qld), contravened the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).[20]\\nOn 12 October 2009, the Antwerp court of appeal declared carrying a kirpan a religious symbol, overturning a €550 fine from a lower court for \"carrying a freely accessible weapon without demonstrating a legitimate reason\".[21]\\nIn most public places in Canada a kirpan is allowed, although there have been some court cases regarding carrying on school premises. In the 2006 Supreme Court of Canada decision of Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys the court held that the banning of the kirpan in a school environment offended Canada\\'s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that the restriction could not be upheld under s. 1 of the Charter, as per R. v. Oakes. The issue started when a 12-year-old schoolboy dropped a 20\\xa0cm (8-inch) long kirpan in school. School staff and parents were very concerned, and the student was required to attend school under police supervision until the court decision[22] was reached. A student is allowed to have a kirpan on his person if it is sealed and secured.[23]\\nIn September 2008, Montreal police announced that a 13-year-old student was to be charged after he allegedly threatened another student with his kirpan. The court found the student not guilty of assault with the kirpan, but guilty of threatening his schoolmates, and he was granted an absolute discharge on 15 April 2009.[24]\\nOn 9 February 2011, the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously voted to ban kirpans from the provincial parliament buildings.[25] However, despite opposition from the Bloc Québécois, it was voted that the kirpan be allowed in federal parliamentary buildings.[26]\\nAs of 27 November 2017, Transport Canada has updated its Prohibited Items list to allow Sikhs to wear kirpans smaller than 6\\xa0cm (2.4\\xa0in) in length on all domestic and international flights (except to the United States).[27]\\nToday,[when?] many Khalsa Sikhs in Canada freely wear their kirpans in public. An example of this is Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh, who wears his kirpan.[28]\\nOn 24 October 2006, the Eastern High Court of Denmark upheld the earlier ruling of the Copenhagen City Court that the wearing of a kirpan by a Sikh was illegal, becoming the first country in the world to pass such a ruling. Ripudaman Singh, who now works as a scientist, was earlier convicted by the City Court of breaking the law by publicly carrying a knife. He was sentenced to a 3,000 kroner fine or six days\\' imprisonment. Though the High Court quashed this sentence, it held that the carrying of a kirpan by a Sikh broke the law. The judge stated that \"after all the information about the accused, the reason for the accused to possess a knife and the other circumstances of the case, such exceptional extenuating circumstances are found, that the punishment should be dropped, cf. Penal Code § 83, 2nd period.\"\\nDanish law allows carrying of knives (longer than 6 centimeters and non-foldable) in public places if it is for any purpose recognized as valid, including work-related, recreation, etc. The High Court did not find religion to be a valid reason for carrying a knife. It stated that \"for these reasons, as stated by the City Court, it is agreed that the circumstance of the accused carrying the knife as a Sikh, cannot be regarded as a similarly recognisable purpose, included in the decision for the exceptions in weapon law § 4, par. 1, 1st period, second part.\"[29]\\nSikhism originated in the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal era and a majority of the Sikh population lives in present-day India, where they form around 2% of its population.\\nArticle 25 of the Indian Constitution deems the carrying of a kirpan by Sikhs to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion and not illegal.[30] Sikhs are allowed to carry the kirpan on board domestic flights in India.[31]\\nIn 2015 an amritdhari Sikh was fined in the Lombard town of Goito, in Mantua province for carrying a kirpan. In 2017 Italy\\'s higher appeal court, the Corte di Cassazione upheld the fine.[32] Media reports have interpreted the sentence as instituting a generalized ban on the kirpan.[33] Amritsar Lok Sabha  MP Gurjeet Singh Aulja met with Italian diplomats and was assured no generalized ban on kirpans is operative, and that the case had only specific relevance to a singular instance and carried no general applicability.[34]\\nSwedish law has a ban on \"street weapons\" in public places that includes knives unless used for recreation (for instance fishing) or profession (for instance a carpenter). Carrying some smaller knives, typically folding pocket knives, is allowed, so that smaller kirpans may be within the law.[35][36]\\nAs a bladed article, possession of a kirpan without valid reason in a public place would be illegal under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.[37] However, there is a specific defence for a person charged to prove that he carries it for \"religious reasons\".[37] There is an identical defence to the similar offence (section 139A) which relates to carrying bladed articles on school grounds.[38] The official list of prohibited items at the London 2012 Summer Olympics venues prohibited all kinds of weapons, but explicitly allowed the kirpan.[39]\\nSimilar provisions exist in Scots law with section 49 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 making it an offence to possess a bladed or pointed article in a public place. A defence exists under s.49(5)(b) of the act for pointed or bladed articles carried for religious reasons. Section 49A of the same act creates the offence of possessing a bladed or pointed article in a school, with s.49A(4)(c) again creating a defence when the article is carried for religious reasons.\\nIn 1994, the Ninth Circuit held that Sikh students in public school have a right to wear the kirpan.[40] State courts in New York and Ohio have ruled in favor of Sikhs who faced the rare situation of prosecution under anti-weapons statutes for wearing kirpans, \"because of the kirpan\\'s religious nature and Sikhs\\' benign intent in wearing them.\"[41] In New York City, a compromise was reached with the Board of Education whereby the wearing of the knives was allowed so long as they were secured within the sheaths with adhesives and made impossible to draw. The tightening of air travel security in the twenty-first century has caused problems for Sikhs carrying kirpans at airports and other checkpoints.[42] As of 2016, the TSA explicitly prohibits the carrying of \"religious knives and swords\" on one\\'s person or in cabin baggage and requires that they be packed in checked baggage.[43]\\nIn 2008, American Sikh leaders chose not to attend an interfaith meeting with Pope Benedict XVI at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center in Washington, D.C., because the United States Secret Service would have required them to leave behind the kirpan.[44] The secretary general of the Sikh Council stated: \"We have to respect the sanctity of the kirpan, especially in such interreligious gatherings. We cannot undermine the rights and freedoms of religion in the name of security.\"[44] A spokesman for the Secret Service stated: \"We understand the kirpan is a sanctified religious object. But by definition, it\\'s still a weapon. We apply our security policy consistently and fairly.\"[44]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Dagger',\n",
       "  'A dagger is a fighting knife with a very sharp point and usually two sharp edges, typically designed or capable of being used as a thrusting or stabbing weapon.[1][2] Daggers have been used throughout human history for close combat confrontations,[3] and many cultures have used adorned daggers in ritual and ceremonial contexts. The distinctive shape and historic usage of the dagger have made it iconic and symbolic. A dagger in the modern sense is a weapon designed for close-proximity combat or self-defense; due to its use in historic weapon assemblages, it has associations with assassination and murders. Double-edged knives, however, play different sorts of roles in different social contexts. \\nA wide variety of thrusting knives have been described as daggers, including knives that feature only a single cutting edge, such as the European rondel dagger or the Afghan pesh-kabz, or, in some instances, no cutting edge at all, such as the stiletto of the Renaissance. However, in the last hundred years or so, in most contexts, a dagger has certain definable characteristics, including a short blade with a sharply tapered point, a central spine or fuller, and usually two cutting edges sharpened the full length of the blade, or nearly so.[4][5][6][7][8][9] Most daggers also feature a full crossguard to keep the hand from riding forwards onto the sharpened blade edges.[5][10][11]\\nDaggers are primarily weapons, so knife legislation in many places restricts their manufacture, sale, possession, transport, or use.[1][2]\\nThe earliest daggers were made of materials such as flint, ivory or bone in Neolithic times.\\nCopper daggers appeared first in the early Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BC,[12] and copper daggers of Early Minoan III (2400–2000 BC) were recovered at Knossos.[13]\\nIn ancient Egypt, daggers were usually made of copper or bronze, while royalty had gold weapons. At least since pre-dynastic Egypt,[14] (c.\\u20093100 BC) daggers were adorned as ceremonial objects with golden hilts and later even more ornate and varied construction. One early silver dagger was recovered with midrib design. The 1924 opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun revealed two daggers, one with a gold blade, and one of smelted iron. It is held that mummies of the Eleventh Dynasty were buried with bronze sabres; and there is a bronze dagger of Thut-mes III. (Eighteenth Dynasty), c.\\u2009B.C. 1600, and bronze armour, swords and daggers of Mene-ptah II. of the (Nineteenth Dynasty) c.\\u2009B.C 1300.[15]\\nIron production did not begin until 1200 BC, and iron ore was not found in Egypt, making the iron dagger rare, and the context suggests that the iron dagger was valued on a level equal to that of its ceremonial gold counterpart.[16] These facts, and the composition of the dagger had long suggested a meteoritic origin,[17] however, evidence for its meteoritic origin was not entirely conclusive until June 2016 when researchers using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed similar proportions of metals (Iron, 10% nickel, and 0.6% cobalt) in a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower.[18][19]\\nOne of the earliest objects made of smelted iron is a dagger dating to before 2000 BC, found in a context that suggests it was treated as an ornamental object of great value. Found in a Hattic royal tomb dated about 2500 BC, at Alaca Höyük in northern Anatolia, the dagger has a smelted iron blade and a gold handle.[20]\\nThe artisans and blacksmiths of Iberia in what is now southern Spain and southwestern France produced various iron daggers and swords of high quality from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, in ornamentation and patterns influenced by Greek, Punic (Carthaginian), and Phoenician culture.[21][22] The exceptional purity of Iberian iron and the sophisticated method of forging, which included cold hammering, produced double-edged weapons of excellent quality.[21] One can find technologically advanced designs such as folding knives rusted among the artifacts of many Second Iberian Iron Age cremation burials or in Roman Empire excavations all around Spain and the Mediterranean.[23] Iberian infantrymen carried several types of iron daggers, most of them based on shortened versions of double-edged swords, but the true Iberian dagger had a triangular-shaped blade. Iberian daggers and swords were later adopted by Hannibal and his Carthaginian armies.[21] The Lusitanii, a pre-Celtic people dominating the lands west of Iberia (most of modern Portugal and Extremadura) successfully held off the Roman Empire for many years with a variety of innovative tactics and light weapons, including iron-bladed short spears and daggers modeled after Iberian patterns.\\nDuring the Roman Empire, legionaries were issued a pugio (from the Latin pugnō, or \"fight\"), a double-edged iron thrusting dagger with a blade of 7–12\\xa0in (180–300\\xa0mm). The design and fabrication of the pugio was taken directly from Iberian daggers and short swords; the Romans even adopted the triangular-bladed Iberian dagger, which they called the parazonium.[21] Like the gladius, the pugio was most often used as a thrusting (stabbing weapon). As an extreme close-quarter combat weapon, the pugio was the Roman soldier\\'s last line of defense. When not in battle, the pugio served as a convenient utility knife.[24]\\nThe term dagger appears only in the Late Middle Ages, reflecting the fact that while the dagger had been known in antiquity, it had disappeared during the Early Middle Ages, replaced by the hewing knife or seax.[25][26]\\nThe dagger reappeared in the 12th century as the \"knightly dagger\", or more properly cross-hilt or quillon dagger,[27] and was developed into a common arm and tool for civilian use by the late medieval period.[28]\\nThe earliest known depiction of a cross-hilt dagger is the so-called \"Guido relief\" inside the Grossmünster of Zürich (c.\\u20091120).[29] A number of depictions of the fully developed cross-hilt dagger are found in the Morgan Bible (c.\\u20091240). Many of these cross-hilt daggers resemble miniature swords, with cross guards and pommels very similar in form to swords of the period.[30] Others, however, are not an exact match to known sword designs, having for example pommel caps, large hollow star shaped pommels on so-called \"Burgundian Heraldic daggers\" or antenna style cross and pommel, reminiscent of Hallstatt era daggers.[31] The cross-hilt type persisted well into the Renaissance[32]\\nThe Old French term dague appears to have referred to these weapons in the 13th century, alongside other terms such as poignal and basilard. The Middle English dagger is used from the 1380s.\\nDuring this time, the dagger was often employed in the role of a secondary defense weapon in close combat. The knightly dagger evolved into the larger baselard knife in the 14th century. During the 14th century, it became fairly common for knights to fight on foot to strengthen the infantry defensive line. This necessitated more use of daggers. At Agincourt (1415) archers used them to dispatch dismounted knights by thrusting the narrow blades through helmet vents and other apertures.[33] The baselard was considered an intermediate between a short sword and a long dagger, and became popular also as a civilian weapon. Sloane MS. 2593 (c.\\u20091400) records a song satirizing the use of oversized baselard knives as fashion accessories.[34] Weapons of this sort called anelace, somewhere between a large dagger and a short sword, were much in use in 14th century England as civilians\\' accoutrements, worn \"suspended by a ring from the girdle\".[35]\\nIn the Late Middle Ages, knives with blade designs that emphasized thrusting attacks, such as the stiletto, became increasingly popular, and some thrusting knives commonly referred to as \\'daggers\\' ceased to have a cutting edge. This was a response to the deployment of heavy armor, such as maille and plate armour, where cutting attacks were ineffective and focus was on thrusts with narrow blades to punch through mail or aim at armour plate intersections (or the eye slits of the helmet visor). These late medieval thrusting weapons are sometimes classed by the shape of their hilt as either roundel, bollock or ear daggers. The term dagger is coined in this time, as are the Early Modern German equivalents dolch (tolch) and degen (tegen). In the German school of fencing, Johannes Liechtenauer (Ms. 3227a) and his successors (specifically Andres Lignizer in Cod. 44 A 8) taught fighting with the dagger.[36]\\nThese techniques in some respects resemble modern knife fighting, but emphasized thrusting strokes almost exclusively, instead of slashes and cuts. When used offensively, a standard attack frequently employed the reverse or icepick grip, stabbing downward with the blade to increase thrust and penetrative force. This was done primarily because the blade point frequently had to penetrate or push apart an opponent\\'s steel chain mail or plate armor in order to inflict an injury. The disadvantage of employing the medieval dagger in this manner was that it could easily be blocked by a variety of techniques, most notably by a block with the weaponless arm while simultaneously attacking with a weapon held in the right hand. Another disadvantage was the reduction in effective blade reach to the opponent when using a reverse grip. As the wearing of armor fell out of favor, dagger fighting techniques began to evolve which emphasized the use of the dagger with a conventional or forward grip, while the reverse or icepick grip was retained when attacking an unsuspecting opponent from behind, such as in an assassination.\\nThe dagger was very popular as a fencing and personal defense weapon in 17th and 18th century Spain, where it was referred to as the daga or puñal.[37] During the Renaissance Age the dagger was used as part of everyday dress, and daggers were the only weapon commoners were allowed to carry on their person.[38] In English, the terms poniard and dirk are loaned during the late 16th to early 17th century, the latter in the spelling dork, durk (presumably via Low German, Dutch or Scandinavian dolk, dolch, ultimately from a West Slavic tulich), the modern spelling dirk dating to 18th-century Scots.\\nBeginning in the 17th century, another form of dagger—the plug bayonet and later the socket bayonet—was used to convert muskets and other longarms into spears by mounting them on the barrel. They were periodically used for eating; the arm was also used for a variety of other tasks such as mending boots, house repairs and farm jobs. The final function of the dagger was as an obvious and ostentatious means of enhancing a man\\'s personal apparel, conforming to fashion which dictated that all men carried them.[39]\\nWW1 trench warfare caused daggers and fighting knives to come back in play. They also replaced the sabres worn by officers, which were too long and clumsy for trench warfare. They were worn with pride as a sign of having served front line duty.\\nDaggers achieved public notoriety in the 20th century as ornamental uniform regalia during the Fascist dictatorships of Mussolini\\'s Italy and Hitler\\'s Germany. Dress daggers were used by several other countries as well, including Japan, but never to the same extent. As combat equipment they were carried by many infantry and commando forces during the Second World War. British Commando and other elite units were issued an especially slender dagger, the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, developed by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes from real-life close-combat experiences gained while serving on the Shanghai Municipal Police Force.[5][40] The F-S dagger proved very popular with the commandos, who used it primarily for sentry elimination. Some units of the U.S. Marine Corps Raiders in the Pacific were issued a similar fighting dagger, the Marine Raider stiletto,[41] though this modified design proved less than successful when used in the type of knife combat encountered in the Pacific theater[42][43] due to this version using inferior materials and manufacturing techniques.[44]\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the Gerber Mark II, designed by US Army Captain Bud Holzman and Al Mar, was a popular fighting knife pattern that was privately purchased by many U.S. soldiers and marines who served in that war.\\nAside from military forces, most daggers are no longer carried openly, but concealed in clothing. One of the more popular forms of the concealable dagger is the boot knife. The boot knife is nothing more than a shortened dagger that is compact enough to be worn on the lower leg, usually by means of a sheath clipped or strapped to a boot or other footwear.[45]\\nThe dagger is symbolically ambiguous. For some cultures and military organizations the dagger symbolizes courage and daring in combat.[46]\\nHowever, daggers may be associated with deception or treachery due to the ease of concealment and surprise that the user could inflict upon an unsuspecting victim. Indeed, many assassinations have been carried out with the use of a dagger, including that of Julius Caesar.[47] A cloak and dagger attack is one in which a deceitful, traitorous, or concealed enemy attacks a person.[48] Some have noted a phallic association between daggers and the succession of royal dynasties in British literature.[49]\\nIn European artwork, daggers were sometimes associated with Hecate, the Ancient Greek goddess of witchcraft.[50]\\nThe social stigma of the dagger originates in its periodic use in the commission of disreputable and murderous attacks, from the 44 BC assassination of Julius Caesar to the use of the stiletto dagger by the Black Hand of early 20th century America. [51] Consequently, it developed a public association with surprise assaults by criminals and murderers intent on stabbing unsuspecting victims.[52] To this day, criminal codes of many nations and some US states specifically ban the carrying of the dagger as a prohibited weapon.[2]\\nThe dagger is in military use as a close combat and ceremonial arm. \\nMany nations use the dagger pattern in the form of the bayonet.[52] Daggers are commonly used as part of the insignias of elite military units or special forces, such as the US Army Special Operations Command, the US Army Special Forces, or the Commando Dagger patch for those who have completed the British All Arms Commando Course.\\n\\nDaggers are a popular form of what is known as the \"art knife\", due in part to the symmetry of the blade.[53] One of the knives required of an American Bladesmith Society Mastersmith is the construction of an \"art knife\" or a \"European style\" dagger.[54][55]'),\n",

       "  'Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She was created by writers James Robinson and David S. Goyer and artist Scott Benefiel, and first appeared in JSA: Secret Files and Origins #1 (August 1999).\\nActress Ciara Renée portrayed the character in The CW\\'s Arrowverse television series The Flash in the first-season finale, appeared in the Arrowverse crossover Heroes Join Forces, and starred in the first season of Legends of Tomorrow.\\nThe new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl\\'s cousin, Speed Saunders. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly JSA series and later in the Hawkman monthly. In 2006, the ongoing Hawkman monthly series was retitled Hawkgirl starting with issue #50 as part of the \"One Year Later\" jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The Hawkgirl comic book series was finished with issue #66.\\nKendra was a recurrent member of the Birds of Prey. Oracle first solicits her assistance in issue #104 in dealing with the Secret Six, for which Oracle rewards her with a car. Throughout the Russian arc, Hawkgirl serves as a team member and develops a rivalry with Secret Six member Scandal.\\nShe was a member of the Justice League of America at its relaunch, but left the team due to injuries sustained in Final Crisis. Kendra and the original Hawkman (Carter Hall) were killed during the Blackest Night storyline; Katar Hol had been killed previously in a final battle with the Hawkgod, and Carter Hall, who had reincarnated in a new body, replaced him as Hawkgirl\\'s partner. Carter and Shiera were resurrected after Blackest Night, but Kendra has since been killed again.\\nKendra Saunders was a young Latina woman who committed suicide. When Kendra\\'s soul left her body, that of her grandfather\\'s first cousin Shiera Sanders Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl and Carter Hall\\'s wife entered it, making Kendra a walk-in. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer Speed Saunders, recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the \"new\" Hawkgirl.\\nKendra had a daughter named Mia, who is not shown but mentioned.\\nStill believing herself to be Kendra, she debuted as a hero using the original Hawkgirl\\'s equipment and set out in search of a being called the Fate-Child (actually her own reincarnated son, Hector Hall). This led to a meeting with the Justice Society and Kendra\\'s induction to that team.\\nShe currently has all of Kendra\\'s memories, but almost none of Shiera\\'s save for fighting experiences. This creates tension with Hawkman since he remembers all of their past lives together and believes they are destined for each other. Kendra has been presented as a very troubled young woman, haunted by the murder of her parents by a corrupt cop and confused by her jumble of memories and feelings. She has operated as Hawkman\\'s partner but only recently begun to actually admit her attraction to him. The truth about Kendra\\'s identity was eventually revealed to her by the angel Zauriel.\\nShe is one of the heroes who fought in space during the Rann-Thanagar War. Following the events of Infinite Crisis, a Zeta Beam transporter malfunction injured many of the superheroes in space, including Hawkgirl, causing her to grow over twenty feet tall. Some time later, her proper stature restored, Kendra was shown living in St. Roch, Louisiana, working in Stonechat Museum and protecting the city as Hawkgirl.\\nShe is also a returning member of the new Justice League, having effectively served with the team when the original members were previously missing. A brewing relationship between Hawkgirl and Red Arrow became one of the major subplots in the series though it appears to have ended. Hawkgirl is now 100% Kendra Saunders. Shiera Sanders\\' soul left Kendra\\'s body and moved on to the afterlife. Shiera hopes her passing on will finally remove the curse of Hath-Set.[1]\\nIn the Hawkman ongoing monthly comic book series, Hawkgirl was presented as a very afflicted young woman, seeking clarity regarding the murder of her parents by a corrupt cop and confused by her jumble of memories and feelings. She had all of Kendra\\'s memories but almost none of Shiera\\'s. This created tension with Hawkman since he remembered all of their past lives together and believed they were destined for each other. She operated as Hawkman\\'s partner, but eventually began to actually admit her attraction to him.[2]\\nOne of Kendra\\'s past lives is revealed as the bounty hunter, Cinnamon, a reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara. As such, she becomes the lover of Prince Khufu\\'s reincarnation, the hero Nighthawk. When Cinnamon is assaulted by the burglar \"Gentleman Jim\" Craddock, Nighthawk hangs him up, thereby tying his destiny to theirs. Cinnamon, along with Nighthawk, is killed by the latest incarnation of Hath-Set, their biggest enemy.[3]\\nKendra eventually meets with the police officer Hawkwoman, who was searching for her missing partner Katar Hol, previously possessed by a creature known as the Hawk Avatar. Also seeking to arrest the Thanagarian criminal Byth Rok, Shayera Thal asked for Kendra\\'s help. Working together they were able to defeat the villain. Before departing to Thanagar with Byth as her prisoner, Hawkwoman gave Hawkgirl her harness as symbol of their recently formed friendship.[4]\\nHawkgirl felt that she wasn\\'t the first person Hawkman would turn to in a moment of crisis, treating her as a damsel in distress incapable of holding her own, and degrading her position in both the eyes of the Justice Society of America and in their partnership. She observed that he would frequently treat her as a sidekick, a relationship that Kendra denied, wanting to be seen as his equal.[5] Toward the end of the series Hawkgirl reveals all of her feelings to Carter, causing him to apologize and admit that he was treating her wrongly all along. The story finishes on a romantic note with the Hawks fighting together during the Rann-Thanagar War.[6]\\nThe Hawkman ongoing monthly series was retitled to Hawkgirl, with Kendra replacing Carter as the lead character. Hawkgirl is seen protecting St. Roch, Louisiana in the absence of Hawkman, and working in Stonechat Museum. She fights Khimaera several times,[7] finally killing her.[8] She is later abducted and put on mock trial for high treason against her people by a group of rogue Thanagarian criminals, at the instigation of Blackfire.[9] After declaring her guilty, one of the rogues ties her hands behind her back, covers her mouth with a piece of duct tape, and attempts to execute her by hanging — whereupon Kendra finds that she can hover without her wings, and is thus able to fake her death and defeat the criminals.[10] Kendra then becomes a direct target of Blackfire who decides to go to Earth, herself, to kill Hawkgirl and Hawkman. Together, the Hawks defeat her and take away her powers.[11]\\nKendra later fights alongside the Furies of Darkseid when St. Roch is attacked by an evil doomsday weapon of Apokolips, a stolen Beta-3 Gizmoid. It turns out that the gizmoid is linked to the Hawks\\' old enemy, Hath-Set, as it had been taken to Earth ages ago and landed in Ancient Egypt during Hath-Set\\'s reign, and hidden in a canopic jar.[12]\\nDue to Hath-Set\\'s efforts to reacquire the jar, the gizmoid is reactivated near Stonechat Museum. According to its programming, it spots Hawkgirl and, choosing her as a template, assumes her form to begin Earth\\'s eradication. Tracking it, the Female Furies arrive by Boom Tube but are rendered conscious.[13]\\nAs a giant mechanized version of Hawkgirl, the gizmoid begins attacking St. Roch with its arsenal of weaponry. Bernadeth and the other Furies try to destroy the gizmoid but are unsuccessful. But, due to her brief connection with the gizmoid, Hawkgirl discovers a weakness whereby she and the Furies are able to defeat it.[14]\\nHawkgirl\\'s plan works and the gizmoid falls to pieces, but afterward the vampiric Bloody Mary, one of the Furies, turns on Hawkgirl as she lies unconscious. Fortunately, Danny Evans had been following the battle and shows up just in time. He manages to delay Bloody Mary just long enough for Hawkgirl to reawaken and subdue her. The Female Furies collect Bloody Mary and reluctantly thank Hawkgirl for her efforts before departing.\\nKendra finally resolves to take the fight to her mortal enemy, Hath-Set, who had been spying on her for some time. Hawkgirl starts getting closer to finding him with the assistance of Batman, Superman, and Oracle.[15] During her search Kendra is kidnapped by Hath-Set and taken to Egypt. Hawkman follows on a rescue mission, but is captured and imprisoned by Hath-Set\\'s minions. Meanwhile, Hawkgirl is able to free herself. She encounters Hath-Set, and after a final battle, kills him and saves Hawkman. The two now finally find peace, breaking the cycle of reincarnation and failure. They can see themselves falling in love again, but with Hawkgirl asserting that, this time, Carter must earn her love.[16]\\nHawkgirl\\'s main story arc in the early issues of Justice League of America Vol. 2 centered around her relationship with Red Arrow. Initially both were looking for a fling, but then found themselves in love, with Hawkgirl even meeting his daughter Lian, a result of his former romance with Cheshire.[17]\\nTheir relationship became one of the major subplots of the series, with Black Canary\\'s disapproval of the relationship bringing some tension to it. Additionally, Power Girl advised Red Arrow not to get involved with Hawkgirl, as she was destined to eventually return to Hawkman (Carter Hall). Despite everything the two started dating, with the Justice League later finding out after Red Tornado caught Hawkgirl and Red Arrow sleeping together.[18]\\nThis was the beginning of a turbulent relationship, with past relationships, parenting, and the inability to express their feelings to each other causing problems. Red Arrow\\'s constant pain due Cheshire\\'s absence, and Hawkgirl conflicted feelings regarding Hawkman brought stress in their romance, causing the couple to fight regularly. Eventually the relationship dissolved and Red Arrow left the Justice League.[19]\\nWhile in a mission with the Justice League inside the Prison Planet, Hawkgirl discovered another ability provided by the Nth Metal, the power to weaken forces drawn from the fabric of space-time. Thus, Kendra was the only member not affected by Kanjar Ro, enabling her to fight against the villain and rescue her friends. Hawkgirl then left the Justice League due to injuries sustained in Final Crisis.[20]\\nIn Blackest Night #1, Kendra is shown having an argument with Hawkman over whether or not to visit Jean Loring\\'s grave with the Atom. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of Ralph and Sue Dibny, now members of the Black Lantern Corps, enter Hawkman\\'s sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, telling him that Hawkgirl never loved him; a claim she refutes with her dying breath. Hawkman is killed shortly afterward, and both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by Black Hand himself.[21]\\nDuring the battling at Coast City, the Atom is chosen by the Indigo Tribe to be more effective against Nekron\\'s forces.[22] The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.[23] In the final battle, the duo are transformed by Hal Jordan into the White Lantern Corps and upon Nekron\\'s destruction, they are both resurrected. Hawkgirl says she remembers all her past lives, then unmasks to reveal herself to be Shiera, she and Carter joyfully reuniting.[24]\\nIn the Brightest Day crossover, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to Hawkworld. While there, Shiera is told by the Entity to stop Hath-Set from killing Carter because if he dies one more time, he will not undergo the cycle of resurrection again.[25] Shiera is attacked in Hawkworld\\'s dungeon and captured by Hath-Set. She is then taken to the Queen of Hawkworld, who reveals to Shiera that she is her mother.[26] Hawkgirl is tied by Hath-Set and Queen Khea to the gateway, and they strike her to lure Hawkman to the location. Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. When Hawkman arrives and draws his attention, Shiera turns the tables on Hath-Set and uses her legs to snap his neck, killing him. In the meantime, Hawkman is held by Queen Khea\\'s control of Nth metal mace and armor, and she puts Carter with Shiera. Queen Khea opens the gateway and enters the portal to the Zamaron homeworld.[27] When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire (Carol Ferris) frees them both to stop Queen Khea\\'s invasion. Hawkgirl soon faces her mother, but the Predator feels the lack of love inside Khea\\'s heart bond with her and does not know if she truly is able to contain the power of true love.[28]\\nThe Predator makes Khea his host, but Shiera and Carter manage to separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway and, animated by the power of the violet light of love, grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian Central Power Battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished, have their lives returned and Carol teleports both of them back to the museum of St. Roch. There, the couple, happy for finally defeating the curse, start to take off their clothes to make love, but they are suddenly interrupted by the apparition of Deadman, brought there by his white ring. The ring gives Shiera and Carter an order that they must live separately to live life stronger (because they appreciate love more than life itself), but when Carter replies by saying they are not going to live apart again, the ring responds \"So be it\" and unleashes a blast of white light that turns Hawkman and Hawkgirl into white dust, while Deadman looks in horror.[29] Deadman orders the ring to resurrect both Hawkman and Hawkgirl, but the ring refuses, and tells him that Hawkgirl is unique and that she was brought back life to overcome what held her back in her past life because she is essential in saving Earth.[30]\\nWhen the \"Dark Avatar\" made his presence known, Hawkgirl and Hawkman are revealed to be part of the Elementals. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing.[31] The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing appears to have brought the Elementals back to normal; however, as Hawkman looks around for Shiera, he discovers that she was not brought back like he was. He is later told by Swamp Thing that Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she is still the elemental of air. Afterward, Hawkman returns home yelling \"Shiera\".[32]\\nIn 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity as part of the publishing event The New 52. In stories set on DC\\'s Prime Earth, the Savage Hawkman story arc \"Hawkman Wanted\" (Savage Hawkman #13-16, and optionally issues #0 and #12) explains the character\\'s place in the New 52. Shayera Thal is revealed as the princess of Thanagar, former lover of Katar Hol and sister of the Emperor Corsar. Initially, she is depicted as a villain, seeking revenge against Katar and coming to Earth to bring Katar to justice for his crimes against Thanagar and the murder of Corsar. It is later evident that Katar was innocent and Shayera is surprised when she discovers her brother alive and behind Katar\\'s arrest in the attempt to part Katar from the Nth metal and own it for himself. She then sacrifices herself to save Katar\\'s life.[33]\\nFollowing DC\\'s Convergence storyline, the Silver Age version of Hawkgirl is featured in a Pre-Crisis universe. With the story taking place right after the events of Shadow of War miniseries, Hawkman and Hawkgirl have been captured inside a domed Gotham City.[34] They are featured working as curators in the city\\'s museum, while also fighting crime against hidden Thanagarians that had the original intent of conquest over the Earth, admitting later that they abandoned it when the dome came down. One of the rogues explains that they have seen the future, and that their universe will not survive. Hawkman and Hawkgirl watch as their world starts collapsing due to the Crisis, but they also realize that there might be a new beginning and they fly off with hope in their hearts.[35]\\nIn March 2016, DC Comics developed DC Rebirth, as a relaunch of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic books. Using the end of The New 52 initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, DC Rebirth restored the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the Flashpoint storyline while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52, including its continuity.\\nFollowing this, Hawkgirl made her first appearance in Dark Days: The Forge and Dark Days: The Casting, which served as a prelude to Dark Nights: Metal.\\nHawkgirl was originally born as Chay-Ara, the lover of the Egyptian prince Khufu. One night, Khufu and Chay-Ara discovered a Thanagarian ship that had landed on Earth. The ship was made of the mysterious Nth Metal. Exposure to the metal forced Chay-Ara and Khufu, as well as their enemy Hath-Set, into a cycle of endless reincarnation through time and space.[36] Chay-Ara lived countless lives, before being reborn most recently as Kendra Saunders, while her lover\\'s latest incarnation is Carter Hall.[37]\\nKendra Saunders made her DC Rebirth debut in Dark Nights: Metal #1, she is introduced as the leader of the current Blackhawks, an anti-apocalyptic team.[38] Seeking to prevent the Dark Knights\\' invasion on Earth, Hawkgirl warned the Justice League of the upcoming invasion of the Dark Multiverse and later worked with the League to help them defeat the Dark Knights. Hawkgirl is also a member of the Immortal Men, a group of the oldest beings of Earth. As such, she was entrusted by the Immortals with the mission of using the Anti-Monitor\\'s astral brain in the Rock of Eternity to destroy the Dark Knights.[39] However, when she tried to do so, she was interrupted by Barbatos who transformed her into a dark-hawk version of herself called Lady Blackhawk.[40] It\\'s later revealed that because of Barbatos\\'s influence, Kendra\\'s bond to the Nth Metal was merged into her being. She now boasts an altered physiology reminiscent to her past life as a Thanagarian, which resulted in the grafting of Nth Metal wings to Hawkgirl\\'s back.[41]\\nHawkgirl regained control of her body after Wonder Woman used her Lasso of Truth on her, restoring Kendra\\'s memories. After finding Hawkman\\'s Nth Metal mace, Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl traveled through a portal to Earth, where they ended up fighting various corrupted versions of the Justice League.[42] During their battle, Hawkgirl encountered Hawkman possessed by the darkness of Barbatos. She was able to release him from the villain\\'s command after encouraging Carter to remember all their past lives together. After assisting in the defeat of Barbatos and the Dark Knights, Hawkgirl is recruited to join the new Justice League.[43]\\nSearching for answers related to her new Nth Metal wings, Hawkgirl went on a mission to Thanagar Prime with Martian Manhunter and John Stewart. There Kendra encountered Shayera Hol, the Silver Age Hawkgirl. Shayera is shown as the Empress of Thanagar and very protective of the planet\\'s secrets. Kendra reveals that Shayera is indeed her previous life and Starman says that the two are existing at the same time is because of Perpetua and the Totality breaking the chain of resurrection and splitting the two. As such, Kendra and Shayera are two completely separate people .\\nLater, Kendra would come to learn that she had a pivotal role in healing the Source Wall that was previously destroyed in the Dark Nights: Metal event. Her Nth Metal wings were entrusted with the power to restore the Source Wall\\'s integrity. After discovering this, Kendra tried to save the universe by sacrificing herself to the Source Wall, but her plan was thwarted by Brainiac.\\nHawkgirl is a member of the relaunched Justice League bi-weekly series, written by Scott Snyder.[44]\\nHawkgirl was a member of the Justice League roster during the events of Death Metal. Kendra, and the rest of the team, were assigned to rescue the Legion of Doom from Perpetua\\'s grasp.\\nHawkgirl is also shown as a member of the Guild of Detectives, a group featuring the greatest detectives of Earth.[45]\\nAfter the conclusion of Dark Nights: Death Metal, Hawkgirl is once again core member of the new Justice League series, written by Brian Michael Bendis.\\nAfter the conclusion of Dark Crisis, with the Justice League disbanding, Hawkgirl got an ongoing solo book, exploring her new life in Metropolis.\\nIn issue #4 of the Hawkgirl ongoing solo book it\\'s revealed that Kendra Saunders is Cuban.\\nIn 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity as part of the publishing event The New 52. Following this, a reimagined Kendra Saunders version of Hawkgirl features in the comic book Earth 2, set in the parallel reality of that designation.[46] Her full origin has not been revealed other than some insinuation of her background as part of a secret program that included Al Pratt.[47] It is later revealed that Kendra Munoz-Saunders is a professional treasure hunter, and was hired by the World Army before an unrevealed event occurred in Egypt that resulted in the grafting of wings to Kendra\\'s back, the same time Khalid Ben-Hassin found the Helmet of Fate.\\nSome time later, Kendra met with the Flash in Europe. She was guided by a certain Fate as to where she might find him. Together, they went to Washington, D.C., and fought Solomon Grundy, without much success.[48] They were later joined by Green Lantern, and subsequently by the Atom. To defeat Grundy, Green Lantern carried him out of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, and stranded him on the moon.[49]\\nDespite his help against Grundy, the Atom, under orders from the World Army, tried to capture Hawkgirl, but she escaped with the help of the Flash. Green Lantern then returned to Earth after removing the danger of the nuclear missiles that the World Army launched under the advice of Terry Sloan. Unfortunately, he had run out of power, after using so much of it to defeat Grundy. He was saved by Hawkgirl, who caught him in mid-free fall.[50]\\nHawkgirl then visited the apartment of Alan Scott who was still mourning over the death of his partner Sam. Hawkgirl\\'s detective skills allowed her to discover that Alan and Green Lantern were one and the same. She tried to convince him to join her and the Flash to form a team against the coming danger.[50] Since then, Hawkgirl alongside the Flash, Green Lantern and Doctor Fate formed the Wonders of the World.\\nDuring the events of The Tower of Fate Hawkgirl is seen New Orleans trying to make Khalid join her in an attempt to fight against the war with Apokolips. Later, she is shown in Louisiana locating a parademon cell, Green Lantern appears and asks for her help with finding why his husband was murdered. Together with Kendra, Alan manages to learn much more about Sam, and within the span of a few hours the treasure huntress has completely outclassed all of the detectives earlier hired by Mr. Zhao. They are flying above the Chinese harbor when Kendra notes that they\\'ve reached the point where there was supposed to be a clue, as one of the containers contain something which is connected to Sam\\'s death. Once they open the container however, Alan and Kendra discover to their shock numerous dead Parademons heaped atop one another. Surprised by their findings and wondering how this got Sam killed, they decide to backtrack to their previous source, the mob leader Eddie Kai.\\nUnfortunately, before they can continue their search the Green reaches out to Alan and implores him to return to America. While Alan resists as much as he can, the force of the command proves too irresistible and he\\'s forced to leave Kendra behind despite her protests, when he leaves however he begs Kendra to keep looking in his place. Still helping Alan with his problem, Hawkgirl is seen in a graveyard searching for answers, there she is attacked by genetically enhanced Apokorats ridden by Apokolips warriors, Batman assists her and tells her to go search for Kanto, the assassin of Apokolips. She finds out that Alan\\'s dead husband, was mixed up with Apokolips battle tech.[51]\\nWhen the second invasion of Apokolips in Earth-2 happened, the Wonders of the World, tried to save Earth-2 from destruction, unsuccessfully, they had to evacuate to an Earth twin, only two million survived the war.[52] In 2015, the follow-on series called Earth 2: Society showed the survivors of Earth-2\\'s war with Apokolips, such as Hawkgirl, Green Lantern and The Flash, finding themselves on a new world having to create a fresh life there.[53]\\nKendra Saunders\\'s version of Hawkgirl is featured in the Gotham City Garage series. She is the youngest member of a very old team. It\\'s revealed that Kendra\\'s parents were killed during an alien invasion, she was later rescued by the Blackhawks and trained from a young age with captain Blackhawk. She is shown using the Lady Blackhawk costume and the alias Kendra Blackhawk. She resigns from the Blackhawks to help the Gotham City Garage against Lex Luthor\\'s attacks.[54]\\nKendra Saunders\\'s version of Hawkgirl is featured in the DCeased comic book series. In this alternative Earth where a zombie-like virus has infected most of the planet, Kendra is one of the remaining survivors. She informs the Justice League that Captain Atom is about to self-implode, giving Black Canary\\'s green lantern ring just enough time to shield them from the blast. Hawkgirl is later able to evacuate from Earth alongside a few civilians and Justice League members.\\nShe is shown in the sequel DCeased: Dead Planet, that is set five years after the original mini-series. The survivors make Earth-2 their new home, but after they receive a distress signal from Cyborg, Kendra, amidst other heroes, returns to Earth to respond to the signal.[55]\\n'),\n",

He came on as an 85th-minute substitute for Josip Ćorić as Lokomotiva won 3–0.[5] He didn't make another appearance for the club until the next season in which he made his European club debut on 30 June 2016 against Andorran side Santa Coloma. He started the match and played 60 minutes as Lokomotiva won 3–1.[6] He then scored his first goal for the club on 3 December 2016 against Cibalia. His 73rd-minute goal was the third as Lokomotiva went on to win 4–1 over the last place side.[7]\\nOn 19 August 2019, Ivanušec signed for Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb, despite interest from Celtic and Olympiacos.[8] He made his debut for Dinamo on 31 August, in a 1–0 derby loss to Hajduk Split at Stadion Poljud.[9] He scored his first goal for Dinamo on 6 November, in a 3–3 draw with Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.[10] After Zoran Mamić was appointed as a manager of the club, Ivanušec became a more significant part of the team.[11] In Mamić's system, Ivanušec simultaneously played as a right winger and an attacking midfielder, switching between the two positions with Lovro Majer during matches.[12] On 26 November 2020, his 22nd birthday, he scored the third goal in the 3–0 victory over Wolfsberg in the Europa League.[13] On 13 December, in a 2–2 derby draw with Rijeka, he scored one of the fastest goals in the history of the Prva HNL, scoring after only 21 seconds.[14] On 11 March 2021, in a 2–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur away, Ivanušec was praised for his performance despite the loss, in contrast to the rest of the team.[15][16][17] A week later, he provided an assist to an extra-time winner by Mislav Oršić, which completed a 3–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur and secured qualification to the Europa League quarter-finals.[18]\\nOn 25 July 2023, Ivanušec scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Astana in the first leg of the Champions League second qualifying round.[19]\\nOn 25 August 2023, Dutch side Feyenoord announced that it had signed Ivanušec on a 5-year contract.[20] He scored his first goal for the club on 16 September, scoring the opening goal in a 6–1 home win against SC Heerenveen.[21]\\nIvanušec made his senior international debut for Croatia on 11 January 2017 against Chile in the 2017 China Cup. He came on as a 90th-minute substitute for Franko Andrijašević as Croatia lost the match on penalties 4–1.[22] He then scored his first international goal for Croatia in the next match against China. He found the net in the 36th minute to give Croatia the lead but China managed to equalize and finish the match 1–1. China eventually won on penalties 4–3.[23] The goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the history of Croatia national team, surpassing Ivan Rakitić.[24]\\nOn 7 June 2019, Ivanušec was selected in Nenad Gračan's 23-man squad for the UEFA Under-21 Euro 2019.[25] He made two appearances at the tournament, in the 1–0 defeat to France and the 3–3 draw with England, as Croatia finished last in their group. In the latter match, he provided Josip Brekalo with an assist for Croatia's third goal.[26][27] On 9 March 2021, he was once again selected for the UEFA Under-21 Euro 2021, being named in Igor Bišćan's 23-man squad for the group stage of the tournament.[28] He stuck out as one of the best players in the team, as Croatia progressed to the quarter-finals.[29][30] In the final group game, the 2–1 loss to England on 31 March, Ivanušec made his 27th appearance for the team, becoming its most capped player in history.[31] On 17 May, he was named in Bišćan's 23-man squad for the knockout stage of the tournament,[32] as well as Zlatko Dalić's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020.[33] On 7 June, he was listed in the UEFA Under-21 Euro 2021 Squad of the Tournament.[34]\\nOn 31 October 2022, Ivanušec was named in the preliminary 34-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[35] but did not make the final 26.[36]\\nDinamo Zagreb\\nCroatia\\nIndividual\\n\"),\n",

It is one of the largest and oldest manufacturers of kitchen knives for domestic and professional use, having been founded in June 1731 by Peter Henckels. It is also one of the oldest operating companies in the World. The brand\\'s namesake was Johann Abraham Henckels (1771–1850), who renamed the brand after himself under his leadership. J. A. Henckels is one of the leading manufacturers of chef\\'s knives.  Since 1970, Zwilling is fully owned by Werhahn KG. The following brands belong to the Zwilling Group: ZWILLING, HENCKELS, Miyabi, BSF, Demeyere, Staub, Fontignac, Ballarini, Flammkraft, and Santos Grills. \\n\"Zwilling\" (German for \\'twin\\') was founded on 13 June 1731 by the German knife-maker Peter Henckels.[1][2] The logo was registered with the Cutlers\\' Guild of Solingen, making Zwilling one of the earliest examples of a trademarked company.[3][4] In 1771, Peter\\'s son Johann Abraham Henckels (1771–1850)\\xa0–  the later namesake of the company\\xa0–  was born.[5][6] The Henckels logo has been in the current shape with a red background since 1969.[7]\\nJ. A. Henckels opened the first trading outlet in 1818 in Berlin,[8] opening a shop in New York City in 1883 and followed a year later by Vienna.[9] The company exhibited its products at the 1851 Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Great Britain, being awarded an international knifesmithing medal.[10]\\nJ. A. Henckels was awarded the Grand Prix prize in Paris in 1900[11] and the Grand Prix of St.\\xa0Louis in 1904.[12][13] It was also awarded with the Prussian State Golden Medal. Henckels was also given a royal warrant of appointment as purveyors of knives to the Imperial and Royal Court of Austria-Hungary (see K.u.k. Hoflieferant (in German)[14][15]).\\nSince 1970, Zwilling is fully owned by Werhahn KG located in Neuss.[16]\\nThe company operates several brands, including Zwilling J. A. Henckels, J. A. Henckels International, Miyabi, Staub, Demeyere, Ballarini, and BSF.[17] Through these activities, the company also operates its own retail shops both in Germany and internationally, among them about 200 sub-stores in China. Since 1970 the company has been owned by the Werhahn Group,[18] with a staff of 3,200 worldwide. Profits amounted to €282 million in 2007, with 80% of its profits generated outside Germany. In 2004, Henckels acquired the Japanese knife manufacturer Nippa, and renamed it Miyabi, and the U.S. beauty specialist Tweezerman, which is operated independently from Zwilling.[19][20]\\nSince 1988, J. A. Henckels has partnered with Solingen-based professional hairdressing equipment manufacturer Jaguar,[21] which became part of the Zwilling group in 2004 to make product for the hairdressing industry, also owning a selection of hairdressing equipment brands.[22]\\nWith the 2008 acquisitions of the Belgian manufacturer Demeyere (stainless steel cookware) and the French group Staub, which produces enameled cast iron cookware, Zwilling moved to expand the cookware segment of its business.[23]\\nIn 1976 Henckels introduced the Four Star line, which is a fully forged knife with a molded handle made of polypropylene and a tang extending into the handle.[24][25] The majority of Zwilling knives have blades constructed from high-carbon stainless steel, which is ice-hardened for sharpness and stain resistance, along with a partnership allowing some products constructed using a microcarbide powder steel with clad layers, which are manufactured in Japan. In 2011 Zwilling partnered with Master Bladesmith and Designer Bob Kramer to launch a series of co-branded knives, stating with a Carbon Steel line.[26]\\nHenckels knives are manufactured in several ways. A large selection of the knife range are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, which is cold-hardened to improve stain resistance. This hardening process consists of cryogenic tempering and involves immersing the finished knife blades in liquid nitrogen.[27] This process is required to get full hardness from most stainless knife steels, as it completes the conversion of austenite to martensite. The process of forging is intended to produce improved cutting-edge retention, weight, balance, and reduced opportunity for metal fatigue. Most of Zwilling\\'s higher end knives are manufactured in Solingen, Germany,[28] while others, including Henckels branded knives are made in Spain and China.[29][30]\\nIn 1909 Henckels set up its first subsidiary in the U.S.,[31] followed by Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, China.

       " ('Bowie knife',\n",
       "  'A Bowie knife (/ˈbuːi/ BOO-ee[2][3][4][5][6])[a] is a pattern of fixed-blade fighting knife created by Rezin Bowie in the early 19th century for his brother Jim Bowie, who had become famous for his use of a large knife at a duel known as the Sandbar Fight.\\nSince the first incarnation, the Bowie knife has come to incorporate several recognizable and characteristic design features, although in common usage the term refers to any large sheath knife with a crossguard and a clip point.[9] The knife pattern is still popular with collectors; in addition to various knife manufacturing companies, there are hundreds of custom knifemakers producing Bowie knives with different types of steel and variations in style.\\nThe early history of the Bowie knife is complicated by murky definitions, limited supporting documentation, and conflicting claims. The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most included some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.[10]  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.[11]\\nThe Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from James Bowie, a notorious knife fighter, who died at the Battle of the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie fought only one personal knife fight[12] (and, if Rezin Bowie\\'s account is true, that fight was not fought with a blade meeting the modern definition). That Sandbar Fight received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the Niles\\' Register of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.\\nThe Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother Rezin Bowie provided a terse history two years after James\\' death. Sixteen years after James\\' death someone (assumed to be James\\' brother John) slightly amended Rezin\\'s explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin\\'s grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.[13][14][15]\\nIn the mid-20th century, a Bowie knife book author took liberties with the historical facts. Some documents were misquoted, some reported facts cannot be confirmed, etc. Others incorporated the errors into their accounts of both Bowie and his knives.[16][17]\\nWith no solid definition and conflicting accounts of knife history, many were credited with the invention or improvement of the blade.[18]\\nThe historical Bowie knife was not a single design but was a series of knives improved several times by Jim Bowie over the years.[19]  The earliest such knife, made by Jesse Clift at Bowie\\'s brother Rezin\\'s request, resembled Spanish hunting knives of the day, and differed little from a common butcher knife.[19] The blade, as later described by Rezin Bowie, was 9+1⁄2\\xa0in (24\\xa0cm) long, 1⁄4\\xa0in (6.4\\xa0mm) thick and 1+1⁄2\\xa0in (3.8\\xa0cm) wide. It was straight-backed, described by witnesses as \"a large butcher knife\", and having no clip-point nor any handguard, with a simple riveted wood scale handle.[20]\\nBernard Levine has reported that the first known Bowie knife showed a strong Mediterranean influence insofar as general lines were concerned, particularly the shape of the traditional Spanish folding knife (navaja), then often carried by immigrants to Mexico and other territories of the Old Southwest.[21]  In an 1828 account of the capture of a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish and South American pirates, the carrying of knives similar to the early Bowie knife is mentioned:\\nAmongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives – weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously. They are about the size of a common English carving knife, but for several inches up the blade cut both sides.[22]After the Vidalia Sandbar fight, Bowie was a famous man, and the Bowie brothers received many requests for knives of the same design. Bowie and his brothers later commissioned more ornate custom blades from various knife makers including Daniel Searles and John Constable.[20] George William Featherstonhaugh described them as, \"These formidable instruments ... are the pride of an Arkansas blood, and got their name of Bowie knives from a conspicuous person of this fiery climate.\"[23]\\nAccording to an 1847 article, the Bowie knife was originally designed to fill the need for a wearable, convenient, close-combat weapon – a short sword much shorter than the saber or other swords of the day, yet still possessing a heavy blade. This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics.[24]  By this time the \\'Bowie knife\\' was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to \"that of a carving knife\".[24][25]  The blade design was described as:\\nBack (spine) perfectly straight in the first instance, but greatly rounded at the end on the edge side; the upper edge at the end, for a length of about two inches [5\\xa0cm], is ground into the small segment of a circle and rendered sharp ... The back itself gradually increases in weight of metal as it approaches the hilt, on which a small guard is placed. The Bowie knife, therefore, has a curved, keen point; is double-edged for the space of about two inches [5\\xa0cm] of its length, and when in use, falls with the weight of a bill hook.[24]Most later versions of the Bowie knife had a blade of at least 8 inches (20\\xa0cm) in length, some reaching 12 inches (30\\xa0cm) or more, with a relatively broad blade that was one and a half to two inches (3.8 to 5.1\\xa0cm) wide and made of steel usually between 3⁄16 to 1⁄4\\xa0in (4.8 to 6.4\\xa0mm) thick. The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally brass or copper) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent\\'s blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat-treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.[28])  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an S-guard)[29] intended to catch an opponent\\'s blade or provide protection to the owner\\'s hand during parries and corps-a-corps.\\nSome Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the hilt known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent\\'s blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping sinew and repairing rope and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.\\nOne characteristic of Bowie knives is the clip point at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a false edge as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of saber fencing to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\".[20]  A brass quillon, usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.\\nThe Bowie knife\\'s design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a carcass, while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the James Black knife in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"[20][30]  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and skinning the carcass.\\nThe first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie\\'s brother Rezin in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.[20]  Period court documents indicate that Rezin Bowie and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin\\'s granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to Louisiana State University that her mother (Rezin\\'s daughter) personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her father.\\nThis knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the Sandbar Fight, a famous 1827 duel between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of Alexandria, Louisiana.[20]  The fight took place on a sandbar in the Mississippi River across from Natchez, Mississippi, and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle, Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.[20]\\nJim Bowie\\'s older brother John later claimed that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft\\'s knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.[31]\\nThe most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to Arkansas blacksmith James Black in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.[20]  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie\\'s original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade. Black offered Bowie his choice and Bowie chose the modified version.[30] Knives such as this, with a blade shaped like that of the Bowie knife, but with a pronounced false edge, are today called \"Sheffield Bowie\" knives, because this blade shape became so popular that cutlery factories in Sheffield, England were mass-producing such knives for export to the U.S. by 1850, usually with a handle made from either hardwood, deer antler, or bone, and sometimes with a guard and other fittings of sterling silver.[20]  The James Black Bowie knife had a blade approximately twelve inches (30\\xa0cm) long, two inches (5.1\\xa0cm) wide, and 1⁄4 inch (0.64\\xa0cm) thick.[32]  The spine of the knife was covered with soft brass or silver, reportedly to catch the opponent\\'s blade in the course of a knife fight, while a brass quillion protected the hand from the blade.[32]\\nIn 1831 Bowie returned with his James Black Bowie knife to Texas, and was involved in a knife fight with three men armed with firearms, who had been hired to kill him by the man he had spared in his 1829 fight.[32][33] According to reports of the time, Bowie used his knife to kill all three men: one assassin was nearly decapitated, the second was disemboweled, and the skull of the third man was split open.[20][32][b] Bowie died at the Battle of the Alamo five years later and in death both he and his knife became an American legend. The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving \"Bowie No. 1\" has been acquired by the Historic Arkansas Museum from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis.[citation needed]\\nBlack soon had a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in Washington, Arkansas. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife\\'s death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.\\nBlack\\'s knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true Damascus steel.[30]\\nIn 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, Daniel Webster Jones. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.\\nThe claims regarding James Black and his knives have been challenged by historians and knife experts.[35][36]  Little can be either proven or disproven; Black was found mentally incompetent before his claims were published.[citation needed]\\nThe birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the Old Washington Historic State Park which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black\\'s shop. The park is known as \"The Colonial Williamsburg of Arkansas\". The University of Arkansas Hope - Texarkana opened their James Black School of Bladesmithing and Historic Trades in historic Washington in January 2020.\\nThe term \"Bowie knife\" appeared in advertising (multiple places) by 1835, about 8 years after the sandbar brawl, while James Bowie was still alive. From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.[36]\\nThe Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the Old Southwest of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.[37]\\nBowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the civil strife in Kansas, the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  John Brown (abolitionist) carried a Bowie (which was taken by J. E. B. Stuart). (p 117)  John Wilkes Booth (assassin of Abraham Lincoln) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody reportedly scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the Battle of Warbonnet Creek). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)[36] Brigham Young, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), used to carry a Bowie knife with him, and dreamed about killing ex-Mormon apostates with it;[38] for this reason, it has a significance to the DezNat (alt-right LDS) community online, who link it to the concept of blood atonement in Mormonism.[39]\\n\\nWith the advent of affordably priced, reliable black-powder revolvers in the US (including surplus ex-Civil war handguns), the popularity of the Bowie knife declined sharply after 1865.  While still quite popular, newer Bowie designs began to incorporate much shorter blades of seven or eight inches, a length more suited to butchering and skinning game animals.  By the turn of the century, the most mass-produced Bowies were being sold as all-purpose outdoor hunting/camping knives. Despite this, the Bowie still retained its ability to serve as a close-in fighting knife.  The USMC Ka-Bar of World War II fame is based on a Bowie design dating back to the classic Marbles Ideal camping/hunting knife first introduced in 1899. Since the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the United States Air Force survival knife which is used by several branches of the US Armed Forces. Each knife is manufactured in accordance with US Government specifications. It features a 5\" 1095 carbon steel clip point sawback blade with a swedge, false top edge and fullers. The handle is made from natural leather with a stainless steel butt cap. The included natural leather sheath comes with a whetstone and leg tie. The sawteeth were intended to cut through the plexiglass canopy of a downed aircraft. Shortly after similar knives with a metal hollow handle appeared allowing small survival items to be stored inside the handle.  Bowies are still popular to this day as evidenced by the plethora of factory-made and custom-made bowie-style knives available to sportsmen and collectors.\\nJim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the Blade magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition of the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.\\nCustom knife maker Ernest Emerson originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.[40]\\nA Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas.\\nFrom the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, the Alfred Williams EBRO Bowie knife became a big seller in the USA.[41] The EBRO trademark was purchased by Adolph Kastor & Sons of New York from Joseph Wostenholm & Sons in Sheffield.[42] Alfred Williams specialized in selling knives to the USA market, and as such, his knives destined for the US market bore the EBRO importer stamp on them along with Alfred Williams\\' name. Original Alfred Williams Bowie knives now sell for substantial amounts in auction. One unique Alfred Williams Bowie knife with a carved handle that belonged to a Texan family sold for $60,000 in auction.[43]\\nAmong the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length and weighing 34 pounds (15\\xa0kg) was made for presentation to an American congressman who offered to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between Roger Atkinson Pryor and John F. Potter). A few huge Bowies up to 9 feet (2.7 meters) long were created for exhibition.\\nOver the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the American Civil War, Confederate soldiers carried immense knives called D-Guard Bowie knives.[20]  Many of these knives could have qualified as short swords and were often made from old saw or scythe blades.\\nThe Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"Arkansas toothpick\", possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period. The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy dagger with a straight 15–25 inches (38–64\\xa0cm) blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the \"Arkansas toothpick\", no firm evidence exists for this claim.[30]\\nKnives made in Sheffield, England, were quick to enter the market with \"Bowie knives\" of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge.[20]  While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England.[44]  Sheffield Bowies were sold with a wide range of etched or stamped slogans designed to appeal to Americans: \"Death to Abolition\", \"Death to Traitors\", \"Americans Never Surrender\", \"Alabama Hunting Knife\", \"Arkansas Toothpick\", \"Gold Seeker\\'s Protection\"...\\xa0American victories and generals were commemorated.  \"Bowie Knife\" is etched on many different designs (including folding knives) of the era.[45]  The British disguised the origin of their products, operating the \"Washington\", \"Philadelphia\", \"Boston\", \"Manhattan\", \"America\", and \"Columbia Works\" in Sheffield. They stamped \"US\", \"NY\", etc. on their blades. The Sheffield \"factories\" were warehouses that collected the work of area craftsmen. The smelters, forgers, grinders, silversmiths, carvers, etchers ... were individuals or small businesses.[46]\\nDuring the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Bowie knife served usefully as a camp and hunting tool, as well as a weapon, and is still popular with some hunters and trappers in the present day.[20]  However, as today\\'s campers and backpackers generally rely on prepared lightweight foods, and have little or no use for a large knife as a weapon or for butchering wild game animals, the traditional Bowie pattern knife is today mostly purchased by collectors or edged weapon enthusiasts.[47]\\nThe Bowie remains popular with collectors. In addition to various knife manufacturing companies there are hundreds of custom knife makers and bladesmiths producing Bowies and variations. The Bowie knife dominates the work produced by members of the American Bladesmith Society.[48]  Collecting antique Bowie knives is one of the higher-end forms of knife collecting with rare models selling as high as $200,000. Even mass-produced Sheffield Bowies from the 19th century can sell in the range of $5,000US to $15,000US.[49]\\nThe Bowie knife has been present in popular culture throughout the ages, ranging from the days of the Western dime novels and pulps to Literary Fiction such as the 1897 classic vampire novel Dracula by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Count Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of the story, Dracula is actually killed by his heart being pierced by Quincey Morris\\'s Bowie knife and his throat being sliced by Jonathan Harker\\'s kukri knife. Bowie knives appeared in the classic works of Americans Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain, Englishman Charles Dickens, and Frenchman Jules Verne.[50]\\nThe Bowie knife was a staple in The Alamo movies of 1960 and 2004; the first three Rambo movies, First Blood (1982), Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), and Rambo III (1988); the film Crocodile Dundee (1986) and its sequel Crocodile Dundee II (1988); and Friday the 13th (1980).[51] The Bowie knife is also Ghostface\\'s signature weapon in the Scream franchise (1996). \\nThe famous singer and musician David Bowie (born David Robert Jones) took the name Bowie after the Bowie knife because, in his words, \"it cuts both ways\".[52][53][54]\\n\\nIn the first-person shooter video game Team Fortress 2, the Sniper character has an unlockable weapon named the Bushwacka, which is styled after a Bowie knife.[55]\\nBecause of its widespread use and deadly effect when used in hand-to-hand fighting, it has been argued by some historians that the Bowie knife was seen by upper-class Americans as the 19th-century equivalent of today\\'s mass-produced handgun or \\'Saturday night special\\', particularly in the states of the Old Southwest.  In 1837, just one year after Bowie\\'s death at the Alamo, Alabama legislators passed laws imposing a $100 transfer tax on \\'Bowie\\' knives and decreeing that anyone carrying a Bowie knife who subsequently killed a person in a fight would be charged with premeditated murder.[56] Louisiana and Virginia prohibited the concealed carrying of any Bowie knife,[57][58] while Mississippi made such knives illegal when carried concealed or when used as a dueling weapon.[59] In Tennessee, the use of Bowie knives to settle disputes on the spot so alarmed the wealthy classes composing the state legislature that in 1838 they not only made the concealed carrying of a Bowie knife a criminal felony, but also prohibited the use of a Bowie knife in any altercation, regardless of self-defense or other mitigating excuse:\\nThat if any person carrying any knife or weapon known as a Bowie knife ... or any knife or weapon that shall in form, shape, or size resemble a Bowie knife, on a sudden encounter, shall cut or stab another person with such knife or weapon, whether death ensues or not, such person so stabbing or cutting shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be confined in the jail and penitentiary house of this State, for a period of time not less than three years, nor more than fifteen years.[56][60]  Even Texas passed legislation in 1871 prohibiting the carrying of a Bowie knife \"on or about one\\'s person\" in public places, a law which remained in place until 2017.[61]\\nAlthough many jurisdictions worldwide have knife legislation regulating the length of a blade one may own or carry, certain locales in the United States have legislation restricting or prohibiting the carrying of a \"Bowie knife\".[62][63][59][64][65][66] Most of these laws were characterized at the time as \\'anti-dueling\\' laws.  However, in this context, the term dueling had degenerated from its original 18th century definition (a rarely used social custom among the wealthy classes) into a generalized description for any knife or gun fight between two contestants.[62][67] In some states, many of these laws are still in force today whereas, in other states, these laws were repealed or amended.[65][61][56][68][69]\\nIn 2017, the old Texas law prohibiting the carrying of a Bowie knife in public was finally updated to allow such carry in most circumstances, with exceptions for knives of a certain blade length which cannot be carried in schools, polling places, places of worship, amusement parks, courthouses, racetracks, correctional facilities, hospitals and nursing facilities, sporting events, and certain establishments selling alcohol.[61] The Texas Legislature designated the Bowie knife as the official state knife of Texas in 2021.[70]\\nIt is argued that the terms \"Bowie Knife\" and \"Arkansas Toothpick\" are too subjective to form the basis of sound legislation.[71]\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\nThe Tamil people, also known as Tamilar (Tamil: தமிழர், romanized:\\xa0Tamiḻar, pronounced [t̪amiɻaɾ] in the singular or தமிழர்கள், Tamiḻarkaḷ, [t̪amiɻaɾɡaɭ] in the plural), Tamilians,[8] or simply Tamils (/ˈtæmɪlz, ˈtɑː-/ TAM-ilz, TAHM-),[9] are a Dravidian ethnolinguistic group who natively speak the Tamil language and trace their ancestry mainly to India\\'s southern state of Tamil Nadu, the union territory of Puducherry, and to Sri Lanka. The Tamil language is one of the world\\'s longest-surviving classical languages,[10][11] with over 2000 years of Tamil literature, including the Sangam poems, which were composed between 300 BCE and 300 CE. People who speak Tamil as their mother tongue and are born in Tamil clans are considered Tamils. \\nTamils constitute 5.9% of the population in India (concentrated mainly in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry), 15% in Sri Lanka (excluding Eelam  Moors),[note 3] 7% in Malaysia, and 5% in Singapore.\\nFrom the 4th century BCE,[16] urbanisation and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coasts of Tamilakam what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil empires, the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, and Pallavas and a number of smaller states, all of whom were warring amongst themselves for dominance. The Jaffna Kingdom, inhabited by Eelam Tamils, was once one of the strongest kingdoms of Sri Lanka and controlled much of the north of the island.\\nTamils were noted for their influence on regional trade throughout the Indian Ocean. Artefacts marking the presence of Roman traders demonstrate that direct trade was active between Ancient Rome and Southern India, and the Pandyas were recorded as having sent at least two embassies directly to the Roman Emperor Augustus in Rome. The Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka. The Chola dynasty successfully invaded several areas in southeast Asia, including the powerful Srivijaya and the city-state of Kedah.[17] Medieval Tamil guilds and trading organizations like the Ayyavole and Manigramam played an important role in Southeast Asian trading networks.[18] Pallava traders and religious leaders travelled to Southeast Asia and played an important role in the cultural Indianisation of the region. Scripts brought by Tamil traders to Southeast Asia, like the Grantha and Pallava scripts, induced the development of many Southeast Asian scripts such as Khmer, Javanese, Kawi, Baybayin, and Thai.\\nTamil visual art is dominated by stylized Temple architecture in major centres and the productions of images of deities in stone and bronze. Chola bronzes, especially the Nataraja sculptures of the Chola period, have become notable symbols of Hinduism. A major part of Tamil performing arts is its classical form of dance, the Bharatanatyam, whereas the popular forms are known as Koothu. Classical Tamil music is dominated by the Carnatic genre, while gaana and dappankuthu are also popular genres. Tamil is an official language in Sri Lanka and Singapore. In 2004, Tamil was the first of six to be designated as a classical language of India.[19]\\nThe vast majority of Tamil people are Hindus and many follow a particular way of religious practice that includes the veneration of a plethora of village deities and ancient Tamil gods.[20][21] A smaller number are Christians and Muslims, and a small Jain community survives from the classical period as well. A smaller number are Buddhists. Tamil cuisine is informed by varied vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, usually spiced with locally available spices. English historian and broadcaster Michael Wood called the Tamils the last surviving classical civilization on Earth, because the Tamils have preserved substantial elements of their past regarding belief, culture, music, and literature despite the influence of globalization.[22]\\nIt is unknown whether the term Tamiḻar and its equivalents in Prakrit such as Damela, Dameda, Dhamila, and Damila was a self designation or a term denoted by outsiders. Epigraphic evidence of an ethnicity termed as such is found in ancient Sri Lanka, where a number of inscriptions have come to light dating from the 2nd century BCE mentioning Damela or Dameda persons. The well-known Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga ruler Kharavela refers to a T(ra)mira samghata (Confederacy of Tamil rulers) dated to 150 BCE. It also mentions that the league of Tamil kingdoms had been in existence 113 years before then. In Amaravati (located in present-day Andhra Pradesh) there is an inscription referring to a Dhamila-vaniya (Tamil trader) datable to the 3rd century CE.[23]\\nIn the Buddhist Jataka story known as Akiti Jataka there is a mention of a Damila-rattha (Tamil dynasty). There were trade relationship between the Roman Empire and Pandyan Empire. As recorded by the Hellenistic Greek historian and geographer Strabo, the Roman Emperor Augustus of Rome received at Antioch an ambassador from a king called Pandyan of Dramira.[citation needed] Hence, it is clear that by at least 300 BCE, the ethnic identity of Tamils was formed as a distinct group.[23] Tamiḻar is etymologically related to Tamil, the language spoken by Tamil people. Southworth suggests that the name comes from tam-miz > tam-iz -  \"self-speak\", or \"our own speech\".[24] Zvelebil suggests an etymology of tam-iz, with tam meaning \"self\" or \"one\\'s self\", and \"-iz\" having the connotation of \"unfolding sound\". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of tamiz < tam-iz < *tav-iz < *tak-iz, meaning in origin \"the proper process (of speaking)\".[25]\\nPossible evidence indicating the earliest presence of Tamil people in modern-day Tamil Nadu are the megalithic urn burials, dating from around 1500 BCE and onwards, which have been discovered at various locations in Tamil Nadu, notably in Adichanallur in Thoothukudi District[26][27][full citation needed] which conform to the descriptions of funerals in classical Tamil literature.[28]\\nVarious legends became prevalent after the 10th century CE regarding the antiquity of the Tamil people. According to Iraiyanar Agapporul, a 10th/11th century annotation on the Sangam literature, the Tamil country extended southwards beyond the natural boundaries of the Indian peninsula comprising 49 ancient nadus (divisions). The land was supposed to have been destroyed by a deluge. The Sangam legends also alluded to the antiquity of the Tamil people by claiming tens of thousands of years of continuous literary activity during three Sangams.[29]\\nAncient Tamils had three monarchical states, headed by kings called \"Vendhar\" and several tribal chieftainships, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination \"Vel\" or \"Velir\".[30] Still lower at the local level there were clan chiefs called \"kizhar\" or \"mannar\".[31] The Tamil kings and chiefs were always in conflict with each other, mostly over territorial hegemony and property. The royal courts were mostly places of social gathering rather than places of dispensation of authority; they were centres for distribution of resources. Ancient Tamil Sangam literature and grammatical works, Tolkappiyam; the ten anthologies, Pattuppāṭṭu; and the eight anthologies, Eṭṭuttokai also shed light on ancient Tamil people.[32][page\\xa0needed] The kings and chieftains were patrons of the arts, and a significant volume of literature exists from this period. The literature shows that many of the cultural practices that are considered peculiarly Tamil date back to the classical period.[33]\\nVedic Sacrifices\\nGiven your fury, which of these then is greater in number\\n—your once eager enemies shamed and despairing after brandishing\\ntheir long spears that throw shadows and their beautiful shields\\nembossed with iron against the power of your swift vanguard\\nwith its shining weapons, or else the number of spacious sites\\nwhere you have set up Yupam (columns) after performing many \\nsacrifices prescribed by the Four Vedas and the books of ritual,\\nfine sacrifices of an excellence that will not die away\\nand charged with a fame that is difficult to achieve,\\noblations that rose rich in ghee and all the other elements \\nof the sacrifice? For you, which is greater in number, O greatness!\\n—Purananuru 15, Translator: George L. Hart[34]\\nCulture and tradition of old tamils can be well known by the text Purananuru which mainly talks about public life and explains how people lived in Ancient Tamil Nadu. The text states that several kings believed that Vedic Sacrifices help in upholding righteousness and brings happiness to the country.[35][36][37][38][39][40] Vedas were considered as the book of Righteousness and did not speak about materialism and Cruelness.[41] The text also explains death rituals and concept of Re-birth. after a person is dead all his family and friends weep and cry, if a husband is dead the wife hits her chest and cries and the bangles break.[42][43] Only men go to cremation ground and the women clean the house and apply cow dung to the front yard of the house.[44] The son or some other relative give the body to the person who performs Ritual rights, further the person performs good rituals with the family members to the corpse and finally gives rice to the corpse, The text explains the significance of rice fed by the person to the corpse, and later the body is burnt.[45][46][47] If the wife dies the men feels so sad and also feels to die, he does not want to sleep on the bed of rock and instead sleep in the bed of fire and same rituals are performed.[48] People who perform good deeds in this birth gets a better birth in his next life,[49][50][51] if a king was so good and generous, The king of Heaven Indra who holds the Vajra welcomes him to Heaven with pleasure.[52] If a person lives a normal life he goes to the world of dead (Probably Pitru Lokam).[53] After all the rituals a Nadukal is kept for the dead king and is worshiped by people.[54] Some poets consider Nadukal as the only god.      \\nAgriculture was important during this period, and there is evidence that networks of irrigation channels were built as early as the 3rd century BCE.[55] Internal and external trade flourished, and evidence of significant contact with Ancient Rome exists. Large quantities of Roman coins and signs of the presence of Roman traders have been discovered at Karur and Arikamedu.[56] There is evidence that at least two embassies were sent to the Roman Emperor Augustus by Pandya kings.[57] Potsherds with Tamil writing have also been found in excavations on the Red Sea, suggesting the presence of Tamil merchants there.[58][full citation needed] An anonymous 1st century traveller\\'s account written in Greek, Periplus Maris Erytraei, describes the ports of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in Damirica and their commercial activity in great detail. Periplus also indicates that the chief exports of the ancient Tamils were pepper, malabathrum, pearls, ivory, silk, spikenard, diamonds, sapphires, and tortoiseshell.[59]\\nThe classical period ended around the 4th century CE with invasions by the Kalabhra, referred to as the kalappirar in Tamil literature and inscriptions.[60][61] These invaders are described as \\'evil kings\\' and \\'barbarians\\' coming from lands to the north of the Tamil country, but modern historians think they could have been hill tribes who lived north of Tamil country.[62] This period, commonly referred to as the Dark Age of the Tamil country, ended with the rise of the Pallava dynasty.[63][page\\xa0needed][64]\\nThe Tamil country is strategically located in the Indian Ocean and had access to a sea trade route.\\nThe names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, are mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature and grammatical works like Tolkappiyar refers to them as the \"Three Glorified by Heaven\", (Tamil:\\xa0வாண்புகழ் மூவர், Vāṉpukaḻ Mūvar).[65] Later, they are mentioned in the Mauryan Empire\\'s Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273–232 BCE) inscriptions, among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly and allied terms with him.[66] The king of Kalinga, Kharavela, who ruled around 150 BCE, is mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription of the confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms that had existed for over 100 years.[67] The Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras, and Pallavas were followers of Hinduism, though for a short while some of them seem to have embraced Jainism and later converted to Hinduism.[63][page\\xa0needed] After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, the Tamil kingdoms were allied with the Satavahana Dynasty.\\nThese early kingdoms sponsored the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in Tamil. The classical Tamil literature, referred to as Sangam literature, is attributed to the period between 300 BCE and 300 CE.[68][29] The poems of Sangam literature, which deal with emotional and material topics, were categorised and collected into various anthologies during the medieval period. These Sangam poems paint the picture of a fertile land and of a people who were organised into various occupational groups. The governance of the land was through hereditary monarchies, although the sphere of the state\\'s activities and the extent of the ruler\\'s powers were limited through the adherence to the established order (\"dharma\"). Although the Pallava records can be traced from the 2nd century CE, they did not rise to prominence as an imperial dynasty until the 6th century.[citation needed] They transformed the institution of the kingship into an imperial one, and sought to bring vast amounts of territory under their direct rule. The Bhakti movement in Hinduism was founded at this time, and rose along with the growing influence of Jainism and Buddhism.[69] The Pallavas pioneered the building of large, ornate temples in stone which formed the basis of the Dravidian temple architecture. They came into conflict with the Kannada Chalukyas of Badami. During this period, the great Badami Chalukya King Pulakeshin II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and defeated the Pallavas in several battles.[70][page\\xa0needed] Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily.[71] However a later Chalukya King Vikramaditya II took revenge by repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II and the annexation of Kanchipuram.[72] The Pallava dynasty was overthrown in the 9th century by the imperial Kannada Rashtrakutas who ruled from Gulbarga. Krishna III, the last great Rashtrakuta king, consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to the Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.[73]\\nUnder Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas became dominant in the 10th century and established an empire covering most of South India and Sri Lanka.[citation needed] The empire had strong trading links with the Chinese Song Dynasty and southeast Asia.[74][75] The Cholas defeated the Eastern Chalukya and expanded their empire to the Ganges. They conquered the coastal areas around the Bay of Bengal and turned it into a Chola lake. Rajendra Chola improved his father\\'s fleet and created the first notable marine of the Indian subcontinent. The Chola navy conquered the dominant Southeast Asian power, the Srivijaya Empire, and secured the sea trade route to China.[76] Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer Empire. The latter half of the 11th century saw the union of Chola and Vengi kingdoms under Kulottunga I.[77][full citation needed] The Chola emperor decisively repulsed an invasion by the Western Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI, who had tried to interfere in Chola politics by installing his puppet, and their defeat of him led to their annexation of Gangavadi and Konkan regions. Vikramaditya VI was confined to his own dominions north of the Tungabhadra.[78] The Chola empire remained formidable during the reign of Kulottunga and maintained its influence over the various kingdoms of Southeast Asia like the Sri Vijaya empire.[79][full citation needed][80] According to historian Nilakanta Sastri, Kulottunga avoided unnecessary wars and had a long and prosperous reign characterized by unparalleled success that laid the foundation for the well being of the empire for the next 150 years.[81]\\nThe eventual decline of Chola power in South India began towards the end of Kulottunga III\\'s reign. It was accentuated by the resurgence of Pandyas under Maravarman Sundara Pandya (1216-1238 CE)[76] The waning Chola fortunes resulted in a three-way fight for the Tamil regions between the Pandyas, the Hoysalas and the Kakatiyas. Even the Kadava chief, Kopperunjinga, rebelled against his Chola overlord, Rajaraja III, and asserted his independence.[citation needed] The Hoysalas played a divisive role in the politics of the Tamil country during this period. They thoroughly exploited the lack of unity among the Tamil kingdoms and alternately supported one Tamil kingdom against the other thereby preventing both the Cholas and Pandyas from rising to their full potential. During the period of Rajaraja III, the Hoysalas sided with the Cholas and defeated the Kadava chieftain Kopperunjinga and the Pandyas and established a presence in the Tamil country. Rajendra Chola III who succeeded Rajaraja III was a much better ruler who took bold steps to revive the Chola fortunes. He led successful expeditions to the north as attested by his epigraphs found as far as Cuddappah.[82] He also defeated two Pandya princes one of whom was Maravarman Sundara Pandya II and briefly made the Pandyas submit to the Chola overlordship. The Hoysalas, under Vira Someswara, were quick to intervene and this time they sided with the Pandyas and repulsed the Cholas in order to counter the latter\\'s revival.[83]\\nTamil history turned a new leaf with the advent of the warrior prince, Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I. In the ensuing wars for supremacy, he emerged as the single most victorious ruler and the Pandya kingdom reached its zenith in the 13th century during his reign. Jatavarman Sundara Pandya first put an end to Hoysala interference by expelling them from the Kaveri delta and subsequently killed their king Vira Someswara in 1262 AD near Srirangam. He then defeated Kopperunjinga, the Kadava chieftain, and turned him into a vassal. The Pandya then turned his attention to the north and annexed Kanchi by killing the Telugu chief Vijaya Gandagopala. He then marched up to Nellore and celebrated his victories there by doing the virabisheka(anointment of heroes) after defeating the Kakatiya ruler, Ganapati. Meanwhile, his lieutenant Vira Pandya defeated the king of Lanka and obtained the submission of the island nation.[84] In the 14th century, the Pandyan empire was engulfed in a civil war and also had to face repeated invasions by the Delhi Sultanate. In 1335, Madurai, the Pandyan capital, was conquered by Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan and a short-lived Madurai Sultanate was established, but was captured in 1378 by the Vijayanagara Empire.\\nThroughout the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire was the dominant power of South India.In the early 16th  century (about 1520 CE), Virasekhara Chola, king of Tanjore rose out of obscurity and plundered the dominions of the then Pandya prince in south. The Pandya who was under the protection of the Vijayanagara appealed to the emperor and the Raya accordingly directed his agent (Karyakartta) Nagama Nayaka who was stationed in the south to put down the Chola. Nagama Nayaka then defeated the Chola but to everyone\\'s surprise the once loyal officer of Krishnadeva Raya defied the emperor for some reason and decided to keep Madurai for himself.[85] Krishnadeva Raya is then said to have dispatched Nagama\\'s son, Viswanatha who defeated his father and restored Madurai to Vijayanagara.[86] The fate of Virasekhara Chola, the last of the line of Cholas is not known. It is speculated that he either fell in battle or was put to death along with his heirs during his encounter with Vijayanagara.[87] Later when the Vijayanagara empire crumbled and fell after the Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE, the Nayaks who had once been viceroys asserted their independence and ruled independently from Madurai and Thanjavur.[88]\\nThe area west of the Western Ghats became increasingly politically distinct from the Eastern parts ruled by Chola and Pandya Dynasties[89] Kerala was until 9th century, culturally and linguistically part of Tamilakam, with the local Koduntamil evolving to Malayalam.[90] This socio-culturally transformation was altered through Sanskrit-speaking Indo-Aryan migration from Northern India in the 8th century.[91]\\nThere is little scholarly consensus over the presence of Tamil people in Sri Lanka.[93] One theory is that cultural diffusion well before Sinhalese arrival in Sri Lanka led to Tamil replacing a previous language of an indigenous Mesolithic population that became the Eelam  Tamils.[94]\\nAccording to their tradition, Eelam  Tamils are lineal descendants of the aboriginal Naga and Yaksha people of Sri Lanka. The \"Nakar\" used the cobra totem known as \"Nakam\" in the Tamil language, which is still part of the Hindu Tamil tradition in Sri Lanka today as a subordinate deity.[95]\\nSettlements of people culturally similar to those of present-day Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu in modern India were excavated at megalithic burial sites at Pomparippu on the west coast and in Kathiraveli on the east coast of the island, with villages established between the 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE.[96][97] Cultural similarities in burial practices in South India and Sri Lanka were dated by archeologists to the 10th century BCE. However, Indian history and archaeology have pushed the date back to the 15th century BCE, and in Sri Lanka, there is radiometric evidence from Anuradhapura that the non-Brahmi symbol-bearing black and red ware occurs at least around the 9th or 10th century BCE.[98]\\nEarly South Indian type black and red ware potsherds found in Sri Lanka, indicate that both region were bound by similar culture and identity.[99] The many Brahmic inscriptions found in Sri Lanka, with Tamil clan names such as Parumakal, Ay, Vel, Uti (Utiyan), Tissa (Ticaiyan), Cuda/Cula/Cola, Naka etc., point out to early close affinity between Sri Lanka and South India.[100] Potsherds with early Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE have been found in excavations in north of the Sri Lanka in Poonagari, bearing several inscriptions including a clan name – vela, a name related to velir from ancient Tamil country.[101] There is epigraphic evidence of people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) in Anuradhapura, the capital city of Rajarata, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE.[102] Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island\\'s affairs from about the 2nd century BCE.[103][104] In Mahavamsa, a historical poem, ethnic Tamil adventurers such as Elara invaded the island around 145 BCE.[105] Tamil soldiers from what is now South India were brought to Anuradhapura between the 7th and 11th centuries CE in such large numbers that local chiefs and kings trying to establish legitimacy came to rely on them.[106] By the 8th century CE there were Tamil villages collectively known as Demel-kaballa (Tamil allotment), Demelat-valademin (Tamil villages), and Demel-gam-bim (Tamil villages and lands).[107]\\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries CE, Pandya and Chola incursions into Sri Lanka culminated in the Chola annexation of the island, which lasted until the latter half of the 11th century CE, after which Chola influence declined in Sri Lanka.[106][108] The Chola decline in Sri Lanka was followed by the restoration of the Polonnaruwa monarchy in the late 11th century CE.[109] In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant Aryacakaravarthi dynasty established the Jaffna Kingdom[110] on the Jaffna peninsula and in parts of northern Sri Lanka. The Aryacakaravarthi expansion into the south was halted by Akalesvara Alagakkonara, the descendant of a powerful feudal family from Kanchipuram that migrated to Sri Lanka around the 13th century and converted to Buddhism.[111] Akalesvara was the chief minister of the Sinhalese king Parakramabahu V (1344–59 CE) and soon became the real power behind the throne. Vira Alakeshwara, a descendant of Alagakkonara, later became king of the Sinhalese,[112] but the Ming admiral Zheng He overthrew him in 1409 and took him as a captive to China, after which his family declined in influence. The Aryachakaravarthi dynasty continued to rule over large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna Kingdom in 1619. The coastal areas of the island were taken over by the Dutch and then became part of the British Empire in 1796. The English sailor Robert Knox described walking into the island\\'s Tamil country in the publication An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, annotating some kingdoms within it on a map in 1681.[113] Upon the arrival of European powers from the 17th century, the Tamils\\' separate nation was described[by whom?] in their areas of habitation in the northeast of the island.[114]\\nThe caste structure of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This led to the emergence of three new Sinhalese caste groups: The \"Radala\" the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava.[115][116][117] The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century.[115]\\nBritish colonists consolidated the Tamil territory in southern India into the Madras Presidency, which was integrated into British India. Similarly, the majority Tamil speaking parts of Sri Lanka joined with the other regions of the island in 1802 to form the Ceylon colony until it gained independence in 1948 with both Sinhalese and Tamil populations.\\nIrrespective of the ethnic differences, the British imposed a unitary state structure in British Ceylon for better administration.[118][full citation needed] During the British colonial rule, many Tamils held higher positions than the Sinhalese in the government, because they were favoured by the British for their qualification in English education. In the Eelam  highlands the lands of the Sinhalese were seized by the British and Indian Tamils were settled there as plantation workers.[119] After the British colonial rule in Sri Lanka ended, ethnic tension between the Sinhalese and the Eelam  Tamils rose. The Sinhalese, constituting a majority of the country, resented the minority Tamils having huge power in the island. In 1948, about 700,000 Indian Tamil tea plantation workers from Sri Lanka were made stateless and deported to India. In 1956, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka passed the Sinhala Only Act, an act where Sinhala replaced English as the only official language of Sri Lanka. Due to this, many Tamils were forced to resign as civil servants/public servants because they were not fluent in Sinhala.[120] The Eelam Tamils saw the act as linguistic, cultural and economic discrimination against them.\\nAfter anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956, 1958 and 1977, and a brutal crackdown against Tamils protesting against these acts, guerrilla groups like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) were established[by whom?]. They aimed to set up an independent Tamil state, Tamil Eelam, for majority-Tamil regions in Sri Lanka. From the 1970s to the late 2000s Tamil Eelam was a proposed independent state that Eelam  Tamils and the Eelam Tamil diaspora aspire to establish in the north and east of Sri Lanka.[121][122] The burning of Jaffna library in 1981 and Black July in 1983, finally led to over 25 years of war between the Sri Lanka army and the Tamil Tigers, in which both sides committed numerous atrocities. This Eelam War led to death of over 100,000 people, according to the United Nations.[123] The Eelam  government and Tamil Tigers allegedly committed war crimes against the civilian Eelam Tamil people during the final months of the Eelam War IV phase in 2009, when the leader of the Tigers, Prabhakaran, was killed.[124] The war led to the flight of over 800,000 Eelam Tamil refugees, many going to the UK and India.\\nMost Tamils in India live in the state of Tamil Nadu. Tamils are the majority in the union territory of Puducherry, a former French colony. Puducherry is a subnational enclave situated within Tamil Nadu. Tamils account for at least one-sixth of the population in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[citation needed]\\nThere are significant Tamil communities in other parts of India. Most of these have emerged fairly recently, dating to the colonial and post-colonial periods, but some date back to the medieval period.[citation needed] Significant populations reside in Karnataka (3 million), Maharashtra (0.5 million), Andhra Pradesh (0.9 million), Telangana (0.3 million), Kerala  (0.5 million), Gujarat (0.1 million) and the National Capital Region (0.1 million).[125]\\nThere are two groups of Tamils in Sri Lanka: the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Indian Tamils. The Sri Lankan Tamils (or Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded laborers who migrated from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.[126] There also exists a significant Muslim population in Sri Lanka who are speakers of the Tamil language. Due to independent lineage, they are listed[13][15] as Moors by the Sri Lankan  government.[127][128]\\nMost Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and in the capital Colombo, whereas most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands.[128] Historically both groups have seen themselves as separate communities, although there has been a greater sense of unity since the 1980s.[129]\\nUnder the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about 40 percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and many of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.[130]\\nSignificant Tamil emigration began in the 18th century, when the British colonial government sent many middle-class and poor Tamils as indentured labourers to far-off parts of the Empire, especially Malaya, Burma, South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique. At about the same time, many Tamil businessmen also migrated to other parts of the British Empire, particularly to Burma and East Africa.[131]\\nMany Tamils still live in these countries, and the Tamil communities in Singapore, Reunion Island, Malaysia, Myanmar and South Africa have retained much of their original culture, tradition and language. Many Malaysian children attend Tamil schools, and a significant portion of Tamil children are brought up with Tamil as their first language. In Singapore, Mauritius and Reunion, Tamil students learn Tamil as their second language in school. In Singapore, to preserve the Tamil language, the government has made it an official language despite Tamils comprising only about 5% of the population, and has also introduced compulsory instruction of the language for Tamils. Other Tamil communities, such as those in South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Pakistan, Martinique, and the Caribbean no longer speak Tamil language as a first language, but still retain a strong Tamil identity, and are able to understand the language, while most elders speak it as a first language.[132][dubious  – discuss] There is a very small Tamil community in Pakistan, notably settled since the partition in 1947.[133]\\nA large emigration also began in the 1980s, as Eelam Tamils sought to escape the ethnic conflict there. These recent emigrants have most often moved to Australia, Europe, North America and southeast Asia.[134][page\\xa0needed] Today, the largest concentration of Eelam Tamils outside Sri Lanka can be found in Toronto.[135]\\nTamils have strong attachment to the Tamil language, which is often venerated in literature as Tamil̲an̲n̲ai, \"the Tamil mother\".[136][full citation needed] It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Tamil identity.[137][full citation needed] It is a Dravidian language, with little relation to the Indo-European languages of northern India. The language has been far less influenced by Sanskrit than the other Dravidian languages, and preserves many features of Proto-Dravidian, though modern-day spoken Tamil in Tamil Nadu freely uses loanwords from Sanskrit and English.[138] Tamil literature is of considerable antiquity, and underpins the decision to recognize Tamil as a classical language by the government of India. Classical Tamil literature, which ranges from lyric poetry to works on poetics and ethical philosophy, is remarkably different from contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages, and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South Asia.[139][page\\xa0needed]\\nVarious martial arts including Kuttu Varisai, Varma Kalai, Silambam, Adithada, and Malyutham are practised in Tamil Nadu.[140] The warm-up phase includes yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. Silambam originated in ancient Tamilakam and was patronized by the Pandyans, Cholas and Cheras, who ruled over this region. Silapathiharam, Tamil literature from the 2nd century CE, refers to the sale of Silamabam instructions, weapons and equipment to foreign traders.[141] Since the early Sangam age, there was a warlike culture in South India. War was regarded as an honorable sacrifice and fallen heroes and kings were worshiped in the form of a hero stone. Each warrior was trained in martial arts, horse riding and specialized in two of the weapons of that period: Vel (spear), Val (sword), and Vil (bow).[142] Heroic martyrdom was glorified in ancient Tamil literature. The Tamil kings and warriors followed an honour code similar to that of Japanese samurai and committed suicide to preserve honor. The forms of martial suicide were known as Avipalli, Thannai, Verttal, Marakkanchi, Vatakkiruttal and Punkilithu Mudiyum Maram. Avipalli was mentioned in all the works except Veera Soliyam. It was a self-sacrifice of a warrior to the goddess of war for the victory of his commander.[143][full citation needed] The Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka reflected some elements of Tamil martial traditions which included worship of fallen heroes (Maaveerar Naal) and practice of martial suicide. They carried a suicide pill around their neck to escape captivity and torture.[144][full citation needed]\\nWootz steel originated in South India and Sri Lanka.[145][dead link][146] There are several ancient Tamil, Greek, Chinese and Roman literary references to high-carbon Indian steel since the time of Alexander\\'s India campaign. The crucible steel production process started in the sixth century BCE at Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh, in Karnataka and in Sri Lanka. It was exported globally, with the Tamils of the Chera Dynasty producing what was termed \"the finest steel in the world\",[by whom?] i.e. Seric Iron to the Romans, Egyptians, Chinese and Arabs by 500 BCE.[147][148][page\\xa0needed][149] The steel was exported as cakes of steely iron that came to be known as \"Wootz\".[150]\\nThe Tamilakam method was to heat black magnetite ore in the presence of carbon in a sealed clay crucible inside a charcoal furnace. An alternative was to smelt the ore first to give wrought iron, then heated and hammered to be rid of slag. The carbon source was bamboo and leaves from plants such as avārai.[150][151] The Chinese and locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Tamils by the 5th century BCE.[152][153] In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Production sites from antiquity have emerged, in places such as Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama and Samanalawewa, as well as imported artefacts of ancient iron and steel from Kodumanal. A 200 BCE Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artefacts and production processes to the island from the classical period.[dubious  – discuss][154][155] The Arabs introduced the South Indian/Eelam wootz steel to Damascus, where an industry developed for making weapons of this steel. The 12th century Arab traveller Edrisi mentioned the \"Hinduwani\" or Indian steel as the best in the world.[145] Another sign of its reputation is seen in a Persian phrase\\xa0– to give an \"Indian answer\", meaning \"a cut with an Indian sword\".[156] Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe and the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East.[156]\\nThe Tamil martial arts also includes various types of weapons.\\nMost traditional art is religious in some form and usually centres on Hinduism, although the religious element is often only a means to represent universal—and, occasionally, humanist—themes.[158][page\\xa0needed][need quotation to verify]\\nThe most important form of Tamil painting is Tanjore painting, which originated in Thanjavur in the 9th century. The painting\\'s base is made of cloth and coated with zinc oxide, over which the image is painted using dyes; it is then decorated with semi-precious stones, as well as silver or gold thread.[159] A style which is related in origin, but which exhibits significant differences in execution, is used for painting murals on temple walls; the most notable example are the murals on the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam,  and the Brihadeeswarar temple of Tanjore.[160]\\nTamil sculpture ranges from elegant stone sculptures in temples, to bronze icons with exquisite details.[161] The medieval Chola bronzes are considered to be one of India\\'s greatest contributions to world art.[162][163] Unlike most Western art, the material in Tamil sculpture does not influence the form taken by the sculpture; instead, the artist imposes his/her vision of the form on the material.[164] As a result, one often sees in stone sculptures flowing forms that are usually reserved for metal.[165][page\\xa0needed]\\nAncient Tamil works, such as the Cilappatikaram, describe a system of music,[166] and a 7th-century Pallava inscription at Kudimiyamalai contains one of the earliest surviving examples of Indian music in notation.[167] Dance forms such as Bharatanatyam have recent origins but are based on older temple dance forms known as Catir Kacceri as practiced by courtesans and a class of women known as Thevaadiyar.[168]\\nNotable Tamil dance styles are\\nIn its religious form, the Karakattam dance is performed in front of an image of the goddess Mariamma.[169] The kuravanci is a type of dance-drama, performed by four to eight women. The drama is opened by a woman playing the part of a female soothsayer of the Kurava tribe (people of hills and mountains), who tells the story of a lady pining for her lover. The Therukoothu, literally meaning \"street play\", is a form of village theater or folk opera. It is traditionally performed in village squares, with no sets and very simple props.[170] The performances involve songs and dances, and the stories can be either religious or secular.[171] Tamil Nadu also has a well developed stage theatre tradition, which has been influenced by western theatre. A number of theatrical companies exist, with repertoires including absurdist, realist, and humorous plays.[172]\\nTheatrical culture flourished among Tamils during the classical age. Tamil theatre has a long and varied history whose origins can be traced back almost two millennia to dance-theatre forms like Kotukotti and Pandarangam, which are mentioned in an ancient anthology of poems entitled the Kalingathu Parani.[173][page\\xa0needed] The modern Tamil film industry originated during the 20th century, has its headquarters in Chennai and is known as Kollywood; it is the second largest film industry in India after Bollywood.[174] Films from Kollywood have been distributed to overseas theatres in Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.[175] Independent Tamil film production inspired by Kollywood originated outside India in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Canada, and western Europe. Several Tamil actresses such as Anushka Ranjan, Vyjayanthimala, Hema Malini, Rekha Ganesan, Sridevi, Meenakshi Sheshadri, Adah Sharma and Vidya Balan have acted in Bollywood and dominated the cinema over the years. Some Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, such as MG Ramachandran, Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, have had a background in the Tamil film industry.\\nThe people of Tamil Nadu play traditional sports and sports from other countries. Tamil Nadu has some notable players in each sport.\\nTamil cuisine includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Some Tamils are vegetarian because of religious reasons.[180][page\\xa0needed] Rice is mostly eaten with vegetarian and non-vegetarian curries. Traditionally, the Tamils sit on the ground and the food is served on a banana leaf. The traditional foods are eaten with the right hand. Dishes such as dosa, idli, and vadai are served with sambar, chutney or in Sri Lanka with coconut sambal. Rasam replaces soup in Tamil cuisine. The Tamil cuisine in Sri Lanka differs little from that of South India.[181] A famous Eelam Tamil specialty is Kottu Roti, available in most Eelam Tamil restaurants in the country and abroad[citation needed].\\nTamils, who primarily inhabit the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka, have a unique genetic heritage shaped by various historical migrations and interactions.[182] Genetic studies have provided us with fascinating insights into the Tamil population\\'s genetic makeup, revealing several areas of interest. For instance, Tamils are primarily of Dravidian origin, with their genetic makeup characterized by a Dravidian component that sets them apart from other South Asian populations.[183]\\nLinguistic studies have identified the Dravidian language family, which includes Tamil, as distinct from the Indo-Aryan languages of northern India. Genetic research has sought to correlate language and genetics, finding a correspondence between linguistic and genetic diversity. Genetic research has also revealed subdivisions within the Tamil population, such as genetic distinctions between Tamil Brahmins and non-Brahmin Tamils.[184] Tamil Brahmins have a North Indian genetic component due to their migration, while non-Brahmin Tamils have a distinct genetic makeup.[185]\\nSome studies have indicated that Tamils share genetic ancestry with other Dravidian-speaking populations, such as the Telugu people and Kannadigas of South India. Genetic studies have distinguished between Tamil populations in India and Sri Lanka,[186] showing some genetic differences due to historical migrations and adaptations. Tamil Nadu\\'s history includes interactions with various cultures and migrations, such as Indo-Aryan migrations, interactions with trade and colonial powers, and more. These have left genetic imprints on the Tamil population, making them a unique and intriguing group to study.\\nReligion in Tamil Nadu (2011)[187]\\nHinduism is the traditional and native religion of the Tamil people. Tamil country has been the bastion of Shaivism and Vaishnavism denominations. A small Jain community has been present since the classical period. Invasions from north India and contact with Arab merchants led to the spread of Islam amongst Tamils. A significant Tamil Christian population is also present, primarily adhering to Catholicism and Anglicanism. Tamils have been following these great religious traditions in different periods with different tendencies. During the Sangam period religions like Ashivakam, Jainism and Buddhism also had a significant following.[188]\\nAncient Tamil grammatical works, Tolkappiyam; the ten anthologies, Pathupattu; and the eight anthologies, Ettuthogai shed light on early religion. Murugan was glorified as \"the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent\" as \"the favored god of the Tamils.\" Sivan was also seen as the formless Supreme God .[32][page\\xa0needed] The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, thinais, based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam mentions that each of these thinai had an associated deity such as Seyyon in Kurinji-the hills, Thirumal in Mullai-the forests, Vendhan in Marutham-the plains, Kadalon in the Neithal-the coasts & the seas and Kottravai in Paalai- the deserts. Other gods mentioned were Mayyon and Vaali who are major deities in Hinduism today. Mercantile groups from Tamilakam and Kerala introduced Cholapauttam, a syncretic form of Buddhism and Shaivism in northern Sri Lanka and Southern India. This religion was transmitted through the Tamil language. The religion lost its importance in the 14th century when conditions changed for the benefit of Sinhala/Pali traditions.[189]\\nThe cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. Amman, Mariamman, Durgai, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kali and Saptakanniyar are venerated in all their forms.[190][page\\xa0needed] The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, who also appear predominantly as goddesses.[citation needed] In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai.[191]\\nAbout 88%[192] of the population of Tamil Nadu were Hindus in 2001.\\nIn Tamil Nadu, Christians (predominantly adherents of the Catholic and Indian Orthodox Churches) and Muslims accounted for 6% and 5.8% respectively in 2001.[192] The majority of Muslims in Tamil Nadu speak Tamil,[193] with less than 10% of them reporting Urdu as their mother tongue.[194] Tamil Jains now number only a few thousand.[195] Atheist, rationalist, and humanist philosophies are also adhered by sizeable minorities.[196]\\nThe most popular Tamil deity is Murugan; he is known as the patron god of the Tamils and is also called \"Tamil Kadavul\" (Tamil God).[197][198][full citation needed] In Tamil tradition, Murugan is the youngest and Pillaiyar the oldest son of Sivan and Parvati. The goddess Parvati is often depicted as a goddess with green skin complexion in Tamil Hindu tradition. The worship of Amman, also called Mariamman, thought to have been derived from an ancient mother goddess, is also very common.[199] Kannagi, the heroine of the Cilappatikaram, is worshipped as Pattini by many Tamils, particularly in Sri Lanka.[200] There are also many followers of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu, mainly in the southern districts.[201] In addition, there are many temples and devotees of Thirumal, Sivan, Pillaiyar, and the other Hindu deities.\\nMuslims across Tamil Nadu Rowthers majority follow Hanafi fiqh and others Shafi\\'i fiqh schools while the Tamil Muslims in Sri Lanka follow the Shadhili school. Rowthers are Tamil tribe who reverted to Islam by Preacher Nathar Shah. While others, Marakkayar, Labbai, and Kayalar clans, are Tamil Muslim clans that trade with the Arab world during the reigns of the Movendars.[202]\\nAmong the ancient Tamils the practice of erecting memorial stones (natukal) had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about the 16th century.[203] It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.[204] They often carry inscriptions displaying a variety of adornments, including bas relief panels, friezes, and figures on carved stone.[citation needed]\\nThe most important Tamil festivals are Pongal, a harvest festival that occurs in mid-January, and Varudapirappu, the Tamil New Year, which occurs on 14 April. Both are celebrated by almost all Tamils, regardless of religion. The Hindu festival Deepavali is celebrated with fanfare; other local Hindu festivals include Thaipusam, Panguni Uttiram, and Adiperukku. While Adiperukku is celebrated with more pomp in the Cauvery region than in others, the Ayyavazhi Festival, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, is predominantly celebrated in the southern districts of Kanyakumari District, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi.[citation needed]\\nIn rural Tamil Nadu, many local deities, called Aiyyanars, are thought to be the spirits of local heroes who protect the village from harm.[205] Their worship often centres around natukal, stones erected in memory of heroes who died in battle. This form of worship is mentioned frequently in classical literature and appears to be the surviving remnants of an ancient Tamil tradition.[206] Munis are a group of guardian gods, who are worshiped by Tamils. The Saivate tradition of Hinduism is significantly represented amongst Tamils, more so among Eelam  Tamils, although most of the Saivate places of religious significance are in northern India. The Alvars and Nayanars, who were predominantly Tamils, played a key role in the renaissance of Bhakti tradition in India. In the 10th century, the philosopher Ramanuja propagated the theory of Visishtadvaitam.[207] Kambaramayanam is the Tamil version of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which was written by the Tamil poet Kambar during the 12th century. The Tamil version is smaller than the original Ramayana written by Valmiki. It is not a translation but tells the story in a different perspective.[citation needed]\\nTamil Jains constituted around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu in 2001.[192] Many of the classical Tamil literature works were written by Jains.[208][full citation needed] According to George L. Hart, the legend of the Tamil Sangams or literary assemblies was based on the Jain sangham at Madurai.[209]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Sgian-dubh',\n",
       "  '\\nThe sgian-dubh (/ˌskiːən ˈduː/ skee-ən-DOO; Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: [s̪kʲənˈt̪u]) – also anglicized as skene-dhu – is a small, single-edged knife (Scottish Gaelic: sgian) worn as part of traditional Scottish Highland dress. Originally used for eating and preparing fruit, meat, and cutting bread and cheese, as well as serving for other more general day-to-day uses such as cutting material and protection, it is now worn as part of traditional Scottish dress tucked into the top of the kilt hose with only the upper portion of the hilt visible. The sgian-dubh is normally worn on the same side as the dominant hand.\\nThe name comes from the Scottish Gaelic sgian-dubh. Although the primary meaning of dubh is \\'black\\', it also has the secondary meaning of \\'hidden\\',[1] which is at the root of sgian-dubh, according to the stories and theories surrounding the knife\\'s origin, in particular those associated with the Highland custom of depositing weapons at the entrance to a house prior to entering as a guest.[citation needed] Compare also other Gaelic word-formations such as dubh-sgeir \\'underwater skerry\\' (literally \\'black skerry\\'), dubh-fhacal \\'riddle\\' (lit. \\'hidden word\\'), dubh-cheist \\'enigma\\' (lit. \\'hidden question\\').\\nGiven that sgian is feminine, the form sgian dhubh might be expected, for a feminine noun causes initial consonant lenition in a following adjective, and indeed the everyday modern Gaelic for a normal \\'black knife\\' is sgian dhubh. However, the term for the ceremonial knife is a set-phrase containing a fossilized historical form. In older Gaelic, a system of blocked lenition meant that lenition did not occur when the adjective started with a consonant of the same group as the final consonant of the noun, and n and d are both dental in Gaelic.\\nVarious alternative spellings are found in English, including \"skene-dhu\" and \"skean-dhu\".[2]\\nThe Gaelic plural, sgianan-dubha, is only rarely encountered in English. The anglicised plural is most commonly skene-dhus (in its various spellings), though skenes-dhu is also occasionally encountered.\\nThe sgian-dubh may have evolved from the sgian-achlais, a dagger that could be concealed under the armpit. Used by the Scots of the 17th and 18th centuries, this knife was slightly larger than the average modern sgian-dubh and was carried in the upper sleeve or lining of the body of the jacket.[3]\\nCourtesy and etiquette would demand that when entering the home of a friend, any concealed weapons would be revealed. It follows that the sgian-achlais would be removed from its hiding place and displayed in the stocking top held securely by the garters.[4]\\nThe sgian-dubh also resembles the small skinning knife that is part of the typical set of hunting knives. These sets contain a butchering knife with a 9-to-10-inch (23 to 25\\xa0cm) blade, and a skinner with a blade of about 4 inches (10\\xa0cm). These knives usually had antler handles, as do many early sgian-dubhs. The larger knife is likely the ancestor of the modern dirk.[5][6][7]\\nBog oak, jet black in appearance, was a very hard wood suitable for the purpose. The handles on the stag knives simulate horn which was also traditionally used. The black dagger (sgian-dubh) was usually carried in a place of concealment very often under his armpit (or oxter). When the Highlander visited a house on his travels having deposited all his other weapons at the front door he did not divest himself of his concealed dagger. Etiquette called for its removal from its place of concealment and displayed somewhere where his host could see it, usually in the stocking on the side of his dominant hand (right- or left-handed).\\nThe sgian-dubh can be seen in portraits of kilted men of the mid-19th century. A portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn of Colonel Alasdair Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry hangs in the National Gallery of Scotland; it shows hanging from his belt on his right hand side a Highland Scottish dirk, and visible at the top of his right stocking what appears to be a nested set of two sgian-dubhs. A similar sgian-dubh is in the collection of The National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland.[8]\\nThe early blades varied in construction, some having a \"clipped\" (famously found on the Bowie knife) or \"drop\" point. The \"spear-point\" tip has now become universal. The earliest known blades, some housed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, are made from German or Scandinavian steel, which was highly prized by the Highlanders. Scalloped filework on the back of the blade is common on all Scottish knives. A short blade of 3 to 3.5 inches (7.5 to 9\\xa0cm) is typical.[citation needed]\\nTraditionally the scabbard is made of leather reinforced with wood and fitted with mounts of silver or some other metal which may be cast or engraved with designs ranging from Scottish thistles, Celtic knotwork, or heraldic elements such as a crest. While this makes for more popular and expensive knives, the sheath is hidden from view in the stocking while the sgian-dubh is worn. The sheaths of many modern sgian-dubhs are made of plastic mounted with less expensive metal fittings.\\nSince the modern sgian-dubh is worn mainly as a ceremonial item of dress and is usually not employed for cutting food or self-defence, blades are often of a simple (but not unglamorous) construction. These are typically made from stainless steel. The hilts used on many modern sgian-dubhs are made of plastic that has been molded to resemble carved wood and fitted with cast metal mounts and synthetic decorative stones. Some are not even knives at all, but a plastic handle and sheath cast as one piece. Other examples are luxurious and expensive art pieces, with hand-carved ebony or bog wood hilts, sterling silver fittings and may have pommels set with genuine cairngorm stones and blades of Damascus steel or etched with Celtic designs or heraldic motifs.\\nWhen worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England, and Wales: in Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 s. 49(5)(c);[9] in England and Wales under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (s. 139)[10] and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (s. 4).[11]\\nHowever, the wearing of the sgian-dubh is sometimes banned in areas with zero tolerance weapons policies or heightened security concerns. For example, they were banned from a school dance in Scotland,[12] and initially banned for the June 2014 celebration of the Battle of Bannockburn.[13]\\nAir travellers are now globally required by airport security to put sgian-dubh in their checked baggage.[14][15][16]\\nA Montreal bagpiper received a ticket from police for wearing his sgian-dubh in public. Police gave Jeff McCarthy a $221 ticket for sporting it in his kilt hose while performing at the McGill University convocation ceremony on 2 November 2016.[17] McCarthy immediately contested the fine and after some delay the ticket was cancelled by The City of Montreal in May 2018, and his knife was returned.[18]\\n'),\n",

It can fillet a tuna in a single cut, although usually two people are needed to handle the knife and the tuna. Often they are used by two people simultaneously, where the second person handles the other end, using a towel wrapped around the blade for protection.[1] The flexible blade can be curved to match the shape of the spine to minimize the amount of meat remaining on the tuna carcass.[2]\\nThey are commonly found at wholesale fish markets in Japan, the largest of which is the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, for which they are often called oroshi-hōchō (卸包丁, lit. \"wholesale knife\"), as there is little need for them elsewhere.

       "  'The kukri (English: /ˈkʊkri/)[2] or khukuri (Nepali: खुकुरी, pronounced [kʰukuri]) is a type of short sword with a distinct recurve in its blade that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It serves multiple purposes as a melee weapon and also as a regular cutting tool throughout most of South Asia. The kukri, khukri, and kukkri spellings are of Indian English origin,[3][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed] with the original Nepalese English spelling being khukuri.[citation needed]\\nThe original spelling and meaning can only be instated by the word khukuri. Kukri is the misspelled word. The khukuri is the national weapon of Nepal, traditionally serving the role of a basic utility knife for the Nepali-speaking Gurkhas,[4] and consequently is a characteristic weapon of the Nepali Army.[4]\\nThere are many myths surrounding the khukuri since its earliest recorded use in the 7th century—most notably a traditional custom that the blade must draw blood before being sheathed, owing to its sole purpose as a fighting weapon. \\nIn addition to its use in combat, the khukuri is also used for a variety of other purposes. It is used by farmers and laborers for cutting crops and clearing brush, and by hunters for skinning and cleaning game. It is also used as a tool for cooking, woodworking, and even as a ceremonial object in some Nepalese religious traditions.\\nResearchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat.[5] Similar implements have existed in several forms throughout the Indian subcontinent and were used both as weapons and as tools, such as for sacrificial rituals.[citation needed] It might have derived from the ancient Indian saber called nistrimsa (निस्त्रिंश), itself possibly based on the Greek kopis brought by Alexander the Great\\'s forces to India in the 4th century BC.[6] Burton (1884) writes that the British Museum housed a large kukri-like falchion inscribed with writing in Pali.[7] Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in Kathmandu.\\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the East India Company came into conflict with the growing Gorkha Kingdom, culminating in the Gurkha War of 1814–1816.[citation needed] It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel Dracula by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula\\'s bodyguards and the heroes, Mina\\'s narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker\\'s kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris\\'s Bowie knife.[8]\\nAll Gurkha troops are issued with two kukris, a Service No.1 (ceremonial) and a Service No.2 (exercise); in modern times, members of the Brigade of Gurkhas receive training in its use. The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both World War I and World War II enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit\\'s situation report. It reads: \"Enemy losses: ten killed, our nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.\"[9]\\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from 5–10\\xa0mm (0.20–0.39\\xa0in) at the handle, and can taper to 2\\xa0mm (0.079\\xa0in) by the point while the blade lengths can vary from 26–38\\xa0cm (10–15\\xa0in) for general use.[citation needed]\\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly 40–45\\xa0cm (16–18\\xa0in) in overall length and weighs approximately 450–900\\xa0g (16–32\\xa0oz). Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a fuller is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including tin Chira (triple fuller), Dui Chira (double fuller), Ang Khola (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\\nKukri blades usually have a notch (karda, kauda, Gaudi, Kaura, or Cho) at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevents the handle from becoming slippery;[10] that it delineates the end of the blade whilst sharpening; that it is a symbol representing a cow\\'s foot, or Shiva; or that it can catch another blade or kukri in combat. The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus.[citation needed] The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.[original research?]\\nThe handles are most often made of hardwood or water buffalo horn, but also ivory, bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of brass or steel.\\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial tang, although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.[citation needed] The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.[citation needed]\\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened chakmak to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a karda. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.[citation needed]\\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper.\\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans.\\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\\nThe kukri often appears in Nepalese heraldry and is used in many traditional, Hindu-centric rites such as wedding ceremonies.[11]\\nThe Biswakarma Kami (caste) are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making.[12] Modern kukri blades are often forged from spring steel, sometimes collected from recycled truck suspension units.[12] The tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle;[citation needed] the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called laha (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a full tang (panawal) configuration.\\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha, the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a chakmak over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to steel their knives.\\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a Sarki.\\nKukris can be broadly classified into two types: Eastern and Western. The Eastern blades are originated and named according to the towns and villages of Eastern Nepal.[citation needed]\\nThe Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as Siru grass leaf like.[13] Khukuris made in locations like Chainpur, Bhojpur, and Dhankuta in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.[14]\\nWestern blades are generally broader. Occasionally the Western style is called Budhuna, (referring to a fish with a large head), or baspate (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal Sirupate blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.\\nThere are Khukuri modelled on the one used by the Gorkhali General  Amar Singh Thapa.[15] The real one is archived at National Museum of Nepal and is more curvy in nature than other traditions.\\nThe kukri is in standard service with various regiments and units within the Indian Army, such as the Assam Rifles, the Kumaon Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles and the various Gorkha regiments. Outside of its native region of South Asia, the kukri also is in service with the Brigade of Gurkhas in the British Army and Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force.[16][17] The kukri is the staple weapon of all Gurkha military regiments and units throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\".[18]\\n\\n'),\n",
       " ('Penknife',\n",
       "  'Penknife, or pen knife, is a small folding knife.[1] Today penknife is also the common British English term for both a pocketknife, which can have single or multiple blades, and for multi-tools, with additional tools incorporated into the design.[2]\\nOriginally, penknives were used for thinning and pointing quills (cf. penna, Latin for feather) to prepare them for use as dip pens and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the nib.[1] A penknife might also be used to sharpen a pencil,[3] prior to the invention of the pencil sharpener. In the mid-1800s, penknives were necessary to slice the uncut edges of newspapers and books.[4]\\nA penknife did not necessarily have a folding blade, but might resemble a scalpel or chisel by having a short, fixed blade at the end of a long handle.[citation needed]\\nDuring the 20th century there has been a proliferation of multi-function pocketknives with assorted blades and gadgets,[5] the most famous of which is  the Swiss Army knife, referred to in British English as penknives.\\nA larger folding knife than a penknife, especially one in which the blade locks into place as a protection, as for skinning animals, is referred to by some as a claspknife.[5]\\n\\n'),\n",
       " ('Thuggee',\n",
       "  '\\nThuggee (UK: /θʌˈɡiː/, US: /ˈθʌɡi/) are actions and crimes carried out by Thugs, historically, organised gangs of professional robbers and murderers in India. The English word thug traces its roots to the Hindi ठग (ṭhag), which means \\'swindler\\' or \\'deceiver\\'. Related words are the verb thugna (\\'to deceive\\'), from the Sanskrit स्थग (sthaga \\'cunning, sly, fraudulent\\') and स्थगति (sthagati, \\'he conceals\\').[2] This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, especially northern and eastern regions of historical India (present-day northern/eastern India and Bangladesh).[3]\\nContemporary scholarship is increasingly skeptical of the thuggee concept, and has questioned the existence of such a phenomenon,[4][5] which has led many historians to describe thuggee as the invention of the British colonial regime.[6]\\nThugs were said to have travelled in groups across the Indian subcontinent,[3] and are said to have operated as gangs of highway robbers, tricking and later strangling their victims. To take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence, which would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose.[7] They would then rob and bury their victims.[8] This led to the thugs being called Phansigar (\"using a noose\"), a term more commonly used in southern India.[9] During the 1830s, the thugs were targeted for eradication by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, and his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman.\\nThe Thuggee units would assume the physical appearance of travellers. Initially they wore turbans and carried with them a certain amount of baggage. Their attire as travellers would deceive peasants and royalty alike.\\nThe methods used by the Thugs were meant to reap maximum loot without being caught. They did not accost travellers unless their own numbers were greater than those of their victims. They flattered travellers they met, which gave them a chance to assess what wealth their targets might have. Many of them avoided committing thuggee near the areas in which they lived, making the discovery of their crimes a difficult task.[10] They often pretended to be either Hindu or Muslim to fool their victims.[11]\\nThey usually attacked in the evening. A common method used was to distract their victims by engaging them in conversation, so that others in the band could strangle them swiftly from behind. To avoid suspicion, they avoided carrying more than a few swords.[12] Sometimes they mutilated the corpses of their victims to avoid detection.[13] The corpses were then hidden or buried.[14]\\nA leader of a gang was called jemadar.[15] Usage of military-style ranks such as jemadar and subedar among Thugs as well as reference to individual members as a \"private\", suggests that the organisation of their gangs had a military link.[16] They used a jargon known as Ramasee to disguise their true intentions from their targets.[13] Although strangulation is one of their most-recognised methods of murder, they also used blades and poison.[17]\\nThe thugs comprised some who had inherited thuggee as a family vocation, and others who were forced to turn to it out of necessity.[18] The leadership of many of the groups tended to be hereditary with family members sometimes serving together in the same band. Such Thugs were known as aseel.[19] Many Thugs insisted, however, that novices were not taught Thuggee by their family but by others who were often more experienced Thugs, sometimes also called a guru.[20] While they usually kept their acts a secret, female thugs also existed and were called baronee in Ramasee, while an important male Thug was called baroo.[21]\\nThey would often avoid killing children of victims and instead adopted them.[22] They sometimes tended to murder women and children to eliminate witnesses or in case they had substantial loot.[23] Some of the thugs avoided murdering victims they considered proscribed according to their beliefs and let other unscrupulous members commit the murder or were forced to let them by those who did not believe in their customs like the Muslim thugs.[24]\\nThe earliest known reference to the Thugs as a band or fraternity, rather than ordinary thieves, is found in Ziau-d din Barni\\'s History of Firoz Shah (written about 1356).[25] He narrated an incident of the sultan Jalal-ud-din Khalji having 1,000 arrested thugs being sent to Lakhnauti or Gaur:[26]\\nIn the reign of that sultan [about 1290], some Thugs were taken in Delhi, and a man belonging to that fraternity was the means of about a thousand being captured. But not one of these did the sultan have killed. He gave orders for them to be put into boats and to be conveyed into the lower country, to the neighbourhood of Lakhnauti, where they were to be set free. The Thugs would thus have to dwell about Lakhnauti and would not trouble the neighbourhood of Delhi any more.There were numerous traditions about their origin; however, nothing is concrete. One recorded by D. F. McLeod traced it to some Muslim tribes formed from those who fled Delhi after murdering a physician. Another traced it to some great Muslim families who fled after murdering a favored slave of Akbar.[27] According to this view, the original Muslim Thugs spread Thuggee amongst Hindus.[28] According to other traditions preserved by the Thugs themselves, they were Kanjars or descended from those who worked in the Mughal camps.[29][30] Others have blamed the rise of Thugs on the disbanding of armies in employment of Indian rulers after the British conquest.[31]\\nIn the 16th century Surdas, in his allegorical couplet, mentioned robbers called \"thags\" who would lure victims into their clutches to kill them and steal their property. Ibn Battuta, on his way to Calicut from Delhi as an envoy to China, was attacked by bandits, who probably were thugs.[32] The Janamsakhis used the term thag to refer to a robber who used to lure pilgrims. Jean de Thévenot in his 1665 account referred to a band of robbers who used a \"certain Slip with a running noose\" to strangle their victims. John Fryer also mentions a similar method of strangling used by robbers from Surat whom he saw being given capital punishment by the Mughals in 1675. He mentioned that three of them were relatives, which Kim Wagner notices is similar to the Thugs who were thought to have engaged in this as a family profession. A decree issued by Aurangzeb in 1672 refers to a similar method and uses the term \"Phansigar\".[33]\\nThe garrote is often depicted as a weapon of the Thuggee.[34][35] Other evidences suggest that the Katar (dagger) was their personal status weapon, the Thuggee wore this weapon proudly across their chest. Early references to Thugs reported they committed their strangulation murders with nooses of rope or catgut, but later they adopted the use of a length of cloth that could be used as a sash or scarf, and thus more easily concealed.[36] This cloth is sometimes described as a rumāl (head covering or kerchief), translated as \"yellow scarf\"; \"yellow\", in this case, may refer to a natural cream or khaki colour rather than bright yellow.\\nThe Thug preference for strangulation accorded the thugs some protection under the law which persisted from the times of the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India from the 1500s.[36] For a murderer to be sentenced to death, he or she must have shed the blood of their victim. Those who murdered but did not shed blood might face imprisonment, hard labor and paying a penalty—but they would not risk execution.\\nPreparations of  Datura metel, the Indian thornapple, (family Solanaceae), a poisonous plant sacred to Shiva[37][38] with powerful deliriant properties, were sometimes used by Thugs to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier.[36]\\nThe Hindi name for the plant धतूरा (dhatūra) is derived from the Sanskrit and was adapted by Linnaeus into the Latinate genus name Datura.[39][40]\\nThe \"River Thugs\" preyed upon people including Hindu pilgrims travelling using the Ganga river and became mostly active during the winter like their compatriots from Murnae, Bundelkhand and Awadh. Their dialect of Ramasee differed from the one used by their compatriots on land and used boats taken on lease from their builders or from a jemadar called Khuruck Baboo. Sleeman states that they tapped three times to give the signal to murder which they always committed during the day. To avoid detection of a corpse, they broke its back and threw it in the river to be eaten by crocodiles and only looted money or jewels.[41]\\nThe British found out about them in Southern India for the first time in 1807, while in North India they were discovered in 1809 with an effort to suppress them being carried out from 1809 to 1812.[42]\\nAfter a dispute developed between the zamindar Tejun and the Thug Ghasee Ram in 1812, the latter took refuge with his family under another landlord called Laljee. Tejun in turn revealed the thugs of Sindouse to Nathaniel Halhed.[43] Thomas Perry, the magistrate of Etawah, assembled some soldiers of the East India Company under the command of Halheld in 1812 to suppress the Thugs.[44] Laljee and his forces including over 100 Thugs were defeated, with the village of Murnae, a headquarter of the Thugs, destroyed and burnt by the Company soldiers.[45] Laljee fled to Rampura and the southern banks of Sindh River but was caught by the Marathas who turned him over to the company.[46][47]\\nBritish authorities had occasionally captured and prosecuted Thugs, circulating information about these cases in newsletters or the journal Asiatick Researches of The Asiatic Society. However, Sleeman seems to have been the first to realize that information obtained from one group of stranglers might be used to track and identify other thugs in a different district. His first major breakthrough was the capture of \"Feringhea\" (also known as Syeed Amir Ali, Khuda Buksh, Deahuct Undun and Daviga Persaud[7]), who was persuaded to turn King\\'s evidence. (Feringhea\\'s story was the basis of the successful 1839 novel Confessions of a Thug). Feringhea brought Sleeman to a mass grave with a hundred bodies, told him the circumstances of the murders and named the Thugs who had committed them.[48]\\nAfter initial investigations confirmed what Feringhea had said, Sleeman began an extensive campaign using profiling and intelligence. Sleeman was made superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1835, an organ of the Indian government first established by the East India Company in 1830.[49] (Dacoity was a type of organised banditry, distinguished from Thugs most notably by its open practice and due to the fact that murder was not an intrinsic element of their modus operandi.) Sleeman developed elaborate intelligence techniques that pre-dated similar methods in Europe and the US by decades.[36]\\nRecords were made in which the accused were given prisoner numbers, against which their names, residences, fellow thugs, and the criminal acts for which they were blamed were also noted. Many thugs\\' names were similar; they often lacked surnames since the Thuggee naming convention was to use the names of their tribes, castes and job assignments in the gangs. Accurate recording was also difficult because the thugs adopted many aliases, with both Muslim and Hindu thugs often posing as members of the other religion. Per the Thug Ghulam Hussain, though Hindus and Muslims avoided eating together, such was not the case for drinking and smoking.[11][7]\\nThe campaign relied heavily on captured Thugs who became informants. These informants were offered protection on the condition that they told everything that they knew. According to historian Mike Dash, who used documents in the UK archives, suspects were subject to bench trials before English judges. Though the trials were lacking by later standards (e.g., suspects were not allowed legal representation), they were conducted with care to protocols of the time. While most suspects were convicted, Dash notes that the courts genuinely seemed interested in finding the truth and rejected a minority of allegations due to mistaken identity or insufficient evidence. Even by later standards, Dash argues, the evidence of guilt for many Thugs was often overwhelming.[36]\\nBecause they used boats and disposed of their victims in rivers,[50] the \"River Thugs\" were able to evade the British authorities for some time after their compatriots on land were suppressed. They were ultimately betrayed to the authorities by one of their compatriots, from Awadh. Forces under Sleeman\\'s command hunted them down in 1836.[51]\\nBy the 1870s the Thug cult was essentially extinct, but the history of Thuggee led to the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871. Although the CTA was repealed at Indian independence in 1947, tribes considered criminal still exist in India.[52][53] The Thuggee and Dacoity Department remained in existence until 1904, when it was replaced by the Central Criminal Intelligence Department (CID).[8]\\nIn Following the Equator, Mark Twain wrote about an 1839 government report by William Henry Sleeman:[48]\\nThere is one very striking thing which I wish to call attention to. You have surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of the Thugs that nobody could travel the Indian roads unprotected and live to get through; that the Thugs respected no quality, no vocation, no religion, nobody; that they killed every unarmed man that came in their way. That is wholly true—with one reservation. In all the long file of Thug confessions an English traveller is mentioned but once—and this is what the Thug says of the circumstance:\\n\"He was on his way from Mhow to Bombay. We studiously avoided him. He proceeded next morning with a number of travellers who had sought his protection, and they took the road to Baroda.\"We do not know who he was; he flits across the page of this rusty old book and disappears in the obscurity beyond; but he is an impressive figure, moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid, clothed in the might of the English name.\\nWe have now followed the big official book through, and we understand what Thuggee was, what a bloody terror it was, what a desolating scourge it was. In 1830 the English found this cancerous organization embedded in the vitals of the empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, and assisted, protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates—big and little native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, and native police, all ready to lie for it, and the mass of the people, through fear, persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings; and this condition of things had existed for generations, and was formidable with the sanctions of age and old custom. If ever there was an unpromising task, if ever there was a hopeless task in the world, surely it was offered here—the task of conquering Thuggee. But that little handful of English officials in India set their sturdy and confident grip upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch! How modest do Captain Vallancey\\'s words sound now, when we read them again, knowing what we know:\\n\"The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from India, and known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalise British rule in the East.\"\\nIt would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this most noble work.Thugs considered themselves to be the children of Kali, having been created from her sweat.[55] However, many of the Thugs who were captured and convicted by the British were Muslims,[56] perhaps up to a third.[36]\\nAccording to colonial sources, Thugs believed that they played a positive role in saving human lives. Without the Thugs\\' sacred service, Kali might destroy all mankind:\\nThe Muslim thugs, while retaining their monotheistic faith, had functionalised Bhavani for Thuggee and she was syncretised as a spirit subordinate to Allah. A Muslim thug caught by Sleeman stated \"In my heart, I take the name of God, when I strangle a man – saying \"thou God and ruler!\" \"Alla, toomee Malik!\" I do not pray to Bhowanee, but I worship her.\" Other Muslim thugs who had agreed to testify for Sleeman, stated they had assimilated Bhavani and started the practice of thuggee.[58]\\nAccording to historian Mike Dash, the Thugs had no religious motive to kill. When religious elements were present among Thugs, their beliefs, in principle, were little different from the religious beliefs of many others who lived on the Indian subcontinent and attributed their success or failure to supernatural powers: \"Indeed all of the Thugs\\'s legends which concerned the goddess Kali featured exactly the cautionary notes which are typically found in folklore.\"[36]\\nDonald Friell McLeod who led the campaign against them in the Rajputana Agency, recorded the traditions of their origins. According to them, they were originally Muslims and were taught Thuggee by the deity Devi or Bhavani. They then joined the Lodha people and migrated to Delhi where 84 tribes which were a part of all the criminal clans of India also became a part of the Thugs. A physician who belonged to these 84 tribes gained prominence after curing a royal elephant and was murdered by other Thugs. A schism developed and they left Delhi, which in turn led to the origin of seven Muslim tribes. According to McLeod, these tribes were named Bhyns, Bursot, Kachinee, Hutar, Kathur Gugra, Behleem and Ganoo. According to him, the thugs from Delhi were separated into more than 12 \"classes\".[59]\\nThe earliest recorded traditions about the origins of the Thugs date back to 1760. Based on genealogies which were recounted by some Thugs, historian Mike Dash stated that the origin of the Thuggee can be dated back to the second half of the 17th century. A general consensus among them was that they originated in Delhi. The thug Gholam Hossyn who was caught in early 1800s stated that his accomplices believed that Thugs had existed since the time of Alexander the Great. Another tradition among Thugs who lived in the early 1800s stated that they had lived in Delhi till the time of Akbar and consisted of seven great Muslim clans, though they had Hindu names, during the period. After one of them killed a favoured slave of Akbar, they left Delhi for other regions to avoid being targeted by the emperor.[27] A Brahmin thug who was interrogated by Sleeman referred to the Muslim thugs as Kanjars though another Thug denied this.[29]\\nKim Wagner asserts that we can analyse their traditions about events after their flight from Delhi \"to a much greater advantage\". A tradition which was recounted by a captive Thug stated that the Thugs had originally tried to settle in Agra and they later settled in Akoopore in the Doab region. However, they had to flee to Himmutpur and later they fled to Parihara after their kings started demanding a larger share of the loot. In turn the original Muslim and Kayasth Thugs helped spread Thuggee amongst other groups like the Brahmins, Rajputs, Hindus, the Lodhi people and the Ahir people.[60]\\nOne thug stated that some of the ancestors of the Thugs were forced to disguise themselves as Khunjurs while they were fleeing Delhi but they were high-caste Muslims. He, however, stated that their claimed descent may be wrong and some of them may be partially descended from poor people who worked in the Mughal army\\'s camps. However, their claim that membership in the Thugs\\' clans was closed to outsiders is contradicted by the fact that people of all backgrounds were allowed to join them by the early 19th century according to available evidence.[30]\\nThey considered it sinful to kill women, fakirs, bards, musicians and dancers.[61] Like the ancient Hindu texts which distinguished robbery from the murder of Brahmins, women or children as violent crimes, many Thugs considered it taboo to kill people who belonged to such categories.[62] Those who worked in lowly professions, the diseased and disabled were also forbidden as victims based on their folk belief.[63] The thugs who broke these rules of the fraternity were often believed to have been targeted by divine punishment and their manner of death was thought to depend upon the rules they broke.[64]\\nThe East India Company officers since the time of Thomas Perry, who was appointed to Etawah in 1811, came to understand that there were many Thug groups and they all viewed themselves to be different from the other groups.[65]\\nThe Thug sects were mostly identified based on their habitat, but also based on their professions. The sect called Jamuldahee was named so because its members lived along the Yamuna river, they hailed from the Doab and Awadh regions. Another stated origin is that their ancestor was the Thug Jumulud Deen. The Telinganie originated from Telangana, Arcottees from Arcot and Beraries from Berar. The Lodaha sect, mostly concentrated in Bihar, were caravaneers named after the lodha or load they carried and according to a Thug from the Doab, originated from the same ancestors of his clan. The Lodahas were prevalent in the region around Nepal in Bihar and Bengal during the tenure of Perry and originally hailed from Awadh which they left around 1700. A Deccan Thug stated that the \"Hindu Thugs of Talghat\", located around the Krishna River, didn\\'t marry with the Telinganies whom they considered to be descendants of lower classes as a result of their professions.[66][67] The Telinganie sect were also disparagingly called Handeewuls (from handi) due to their eating habits.[68]\\nThe Pungoo or Bungoo of Bengal derived their name from the region, with the Lodhees or Lodaha also present. The Motheea sect of Rampur-Purnia region was from a caste of weavers and their name derived from the practice of giving \"handful\" (muhti) of the spoils to the head. In the Uttar Pradesh the sects were: the Korkureeas from Kohrur, Agureeas of Agra, Jumaldahees, Lodhees and Tundals. The Multaneea were from Multan. In Madhya Pradesh the sects were: Bangureeas or Banjaras, Balheems or Bulheems, Khokhureeas and Soopurreeas of Sheopur. In modern Rajasthan, the sects were Guguras whose name derives from river Ghaggar and Sooseeas who were part of the Dhanuk clan. The Dhoulanee sect existed in modern-day Maharashtra. The Duckunies of Deccan were from Munirabad and Kurnaketies from Carnatic region. Another sect was Kathurs whose name derives from a bowl called kathota, based on a tradition of a man who held it during celebrations by Thugs. The Qulundera sect\\'s name was derived from the Muslim saints called qalandar. There were also Jogee thugs who were divided into twelve sub-groups.[69]\\nAccording to Feringheea, the Brahmins of Tehngoor village of Parihar were taught the Thuggee after they accompanied the kings of Meos to Delhi and later helped in spreading it in the region around Murnae. He also states that two of his ancestors who had settled and intermarried with Brahmins of Murnae about seven generations ago, which led to the introduction of Thuggee in the area. A Thug hailing from Shikohabad whilst talking of his clan\\'s origin recounted to Perry a tradition that the Munhars were influenced to take up Thuggee after witnessing the immense plunder acquired by Afghans, Mewatties and the Sheikhs.[70]\\nSleeman in 1839 identified a band called \"Meypunnaists\" who he stated abducted children to sell them further. Another band called \"Tashmabazes\" who used methods introduced by a soldier named Creagh who was deployed at Cawnpore in 1802 were also identified by him.[71] The group called \"River Thugs\" were based deep in the South Bengal region.[51]\\nThe British generally took the view that Thuggee was a type of ritual murder practiced by worshippers of the goddess Kali. Sleeman\\'s view of it as an aberrant faith was based on the contemporary British view that Hinduism was a despicable and immoral faith founded on idol-worship.[72] R. C. Sherwood in Asiatick Resarches published in 1820 traces this phenomenon back to the Muslim conquests of India and suggests links to Hindu mythology.[73] Charles Trevelyan however instead of seeing them as a deviant sect, considered them to be representatives of the \"essence\" of Hinduism which he considered as \"evil\" and \"false\".[74] Sleeman considered some Brahmins acted as intelligence providers to Thugs, claiming that they profited from Thuggee and directed it.[75]\\nKali\\'s worship by thugs, both Muslims and Hindus, was emphasised by the British. McLeod commented, \"It is a notable fact that not only amongst the Thugs, but in an especial manner among all lawless fraternities, and to a certain extent throughout the uneducated population of Central India, the Mussulmans vie with the Hindus in a devotion of this sanguinary deity (Devi or Bhavani) far exceeding that they pay to any other.\"[76] David Ochterlony blamed the Pindaris for the rise of Thuggee while Sleeman blamed it on Indian rulers dismissing their armies which took away the jobs of many soldiers.[31] Based on Sleeman\\'s writings about the Thugs, Robert Vane Russell claimed that most of them were Kanjars. He viewed the Muslim Kanjars as having recently converted to Islam.[29]\\nIn 1882 Alexander Cunningham commented on Hiouen-Thsang\\'s remarks about \"people who visited Kahalgaon and forgot to leave it\", speculating that the actual reason might not have been that posited by the monk and noting Kahalgaon\\'s later reputation as a place frequented by the \"River Thugs\".[26]\\nContemporary scholars have become increasingly sceptical of the \"thuggee\" concept, and have even questioned the existence of such a phenomenon.[4][5][6] The British representation of Thuggee is held by some critics to be full of inconsistencies and exaggerations. Numerous historians have described \"thuggee\" as basically the invention of the British colonial regime.[77] However, the more radical critics in this camp have themselves been criticized for focusing overly on British perceptions of thuggee rather than on the historical accuracy of primary source documents, but conclude that \"the colonial representation of thuggee cannot be taken at face value\".[78]\\nMartine van Woerkens of École Pratique des Hautes Études writes that evidence for a Thug cult in the 19th century was the product of \"colonial imaginings\", arising from British fear of the little-known interior of India, as well as limited understanding of the religious and social practices of its inhabitants.[79]\\nCynthia Ann Humes states that the testimony of most of the thugs captured by Sleeman does not support his view of priests profiting from and directing the Thugs. She adds that the Islamic idea of fate or Iqbal was more commonly invoked during Thuggee acts, while invoking the Hindu Bhavani was far more rare.[75]\\nHistorian Kim Wagner views the policies of East India Company in relation to the dismissal of armies of the conquered Indian kingdoms as being responsible for the development of Thuggee. Roaming bands of freelance soldiers had often joined one kingdom or another during the pre-British era, with the main income of many armies coming from plunder. After being dismissed from military service, they turned to robbery as a means of subsistence.[31] He also contested whether the thugs mentioned by Firuz Shah Tughlaq\\'s biography were actually the same Thugs the British authorities fought against.[80]\\nSagnik Bhattacharya agrees with the sceptics and claims the thug-phenomenon to be nothing but a manifestation of the fear of the unknown that dawned on the British Raj at the thought of being alone in the wilderness of Central India. Using literary and legal sources, he has connected the \"information panic\" of the thug-phenomenon to the limitations of British demographic models that fell short of truly capturing the ethnic diversity of India. He explains the thug panic of the 1830s as being caused by the Raj\\'s angst at realizing its own ignorance of local society.[81]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Knife',\n",
       "  'A knife (pl.: knives; from Old Norse knifr \\'knife, dirk\\'[1]) is a tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. One of the earliest tools used by humanity, knives appeared at least 2.5 million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools.[2][3] Originally made of wood, bone, and stone (such as flint and obsidian), over the centuries, in step with improvements in both metallurgy and manufacturing, knife blades have been made from copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and titanium. Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin.\\nKnives can serve various purposes. Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocketknife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods (the chef\\'s knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knife (butter knives and steak knives), weapons (daggers or switchblades), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the kirpan).[4]\\nA modern knife consists of:\\nThe blade edge can be plain or serrated, or a combination of both. Single-edged knives may have a reverse edge or false edge occupying a section of the spine. These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.\\nThe handle, used to grip and manipulate the blade safely, may include a tang, a portion of the blade that extends into the handle. Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into the handle, known as \"stick tangs\") or full tangs (extending the full length of the handle, often visible on top and bottom). There is also the enterçado construction method present in antique knives from Brazil, such as the Sorocaban Knife, which consists in riveting a repurposed blade to the ricasso of a bladeless handle. The handle may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of the handle. The bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.\\nKnife blades can be manufactured from a variety of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminated blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Damascus steel is a form of pattern welding with similarities to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.[5]\\nTitanium is a metal that has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more flexible than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy allow them to be heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and are typically serrated. They are often disposable.\\nSteel blades are commonly shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades are made by heating a single piece of steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes.[6] Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers\\' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.\\nKnives are sharpened in various ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a straight or convex line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend to the back of the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have concave, beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts.[citation needed] Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. Serrated blades are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive \\'sawing\\' motions, whereas plain edge blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).\\nMany knives have holes in the blade for various uses. Holes are commonly drilled in blades to reduce friction while cutting, increase single-handed usability of pocket knives, and, for butchers\\' knives, allow hanging out of the way when not in use.\\nA fixed blade knife, sometimes called a sheath knife, does not fold or slide, and is typically stronger due to the tang, the extension of the blade into the handle, and lack of moving parts.\\nA folding knife connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, allowing the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent injury to the knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user\\'s hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.\\nPopular locking mechanisms include:\\nAnother prominent feature of many folding knives is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and Swiss Army knives commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a stud, hole, disk, or flipper located on the blade, all of which have the benefit of allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.\\nThe \"wave\" feature is another prominent design, which uses a part of the blade that protrudes outward to catch on one\\'s pocket as it is drawn, thus opening the blade; this was patented by Ernest Emerson and is not only used on many of the Emerson knives, but also on knives produced by several other manufacturers, notably Spyderco and Cold Steel.[17]\\nAutomatic or switchblade knives open using the stored energy from a spring that is released when the user presses a button or lever or other actuator built into the handle of the knife. Automatic knives are severely restricted by law in the UK and most American states.[18]\\nIncreasingly common are assisted opening knives which use springs to propel the blade once the user has moved it past a certain angle. These differ from automatic or switchblade knives in that the blade is not released by means of a button or catch on the handle; rather, the blade itself is the actuator. Most assisted openers use flippers as their opening mechanism. Assisted opening knives can be as fast or faster than automatic knives to deploy.[19]\\nIn the lock back, as in many folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade prevents it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade from rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.\\nWhen negative pressure (pushing down on the spine) is applied to the blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade\\'s tang to the hook on the rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the Tri-Ad Lock which introduces a pin in front of the rocker bar to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.\\nThe bolt in the bolt lock is a rectangle of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang of the blade preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through the handle of the knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backward freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade.[13] The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.[14]\\nIn the liner lock, an L-shaped split in the liner allows part of the liner to move sideways from its resting position against the handle to the centre of the knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate.[8] A frame lock is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.[8]\\nA sliding knife is a knife that can be opened by sliding the knife blade out the front of the handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an OTF (out-the-front) switchblade, which only requires the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).\\nThe handles of knives can be made from a number of different materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Handles are produced in a wide variety of shapes and styles. Handles are often textured to enhance grip.\\nMore exotic materials usually only seen on art or ceremonial knives include: Stone, bone, mammoth tooth, mammoth ivory, oosik (walrus penis bone), walrus tusk, antler (often called stag in a knife context), sheep horn, buffalo horn, teeth, and mop (mother of pearl or \"pearl\"). Many materials have been employed in knife handles.\\nHandles may be adapted to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. For example, knife handles may be made thicker or with more cushioning for people with arthritis in their hands. A non-slip handle accommodates people with palmar hyperhidrosis.\\nAs a weapon, the knife is universally adopted as an essential tool. It is the essential element of a knife fight. For example:\\nA primary aspect of the knife as a tool includes dining, used either in food preparation or as cutlery. Examples of this include:\\nAs a utility tool the knife can take many forms, including:\\nThe knife plays a significant role in some cultures through ritual and superstition, as the knife was an essential tool for survival since early man.[3] Knife symbols can be found in various cultures to symbolize all stages of life; for example, a knife placed under the bed while giving birth is said to ease the pain, or, stuck into the headboard of a cradle, to protect the baby;[citation needed] knives were included in some Anglo-Saxon burial rites, so the dead would not be defenseless in the next world.[21][22] The knife plays an important role in some initiation rites, and many cultures perform rituals with a variety of knives, including the ceremonial sacrifices of animals.[23] Samurai warriors, as part of bushido, could perform ritual suicide, or seppuku, with a tantō, a common Japanese knife.[24] An athame, a ceremonial knife, is used in Wicca and derived forms of neopagan witchcraft.[25][26]\\nIn Greece, a black-handled knife placed under the pillow is used to keep away nightmares.[citation needed] As early as 1646 reference is made to a superstition of laying a knife across another piece of cutlery being a sign of witchcraft.[27] A common belief is that if a knife is given as a gift, the relationship of the giver and recipient will be severed. Something such as a small coin, dove or a valuable item is exchanged for the gift, rendering \"payment.\"[citation needed]\\nSome types of knives are restricted by law, and carrying of knives may be regulated, because they are often used in crime, although restrictions vary greatly by jurisdiction and type of knife. For example, some laws prohibit carrying knives in public while other laws prohibit possession of certain knives, such as switchblades.[28][29]\\n'),\n",
       " ('V-42 stiletto',\n",
       "  '\\nThe V-42 stiletto was a fighting knife issued during World War II to the First Special Service Force (1st SSF or FSSF, also known as Devil\\'s Brigade), a joint American/Canadian commando unit.\\nBased on the Fairbairn–Sykes commando knife designed by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, the Fighting Commando Knife, Type V-42 used a narrow-profile, double-edged blade made of high carbon steel. Its double-edged blade distinguished it from the traditional European stiletto, a stabbing weapon with, typically, a blade without sharpened edges.[1]\\nThe V-42 was primarily designed by officers of the FSSF, including its commanding officer, Lt. Colonel Robert T. Frederick, who desired a close-quarters combat knife.[1][2]  The blade\\'s design has been attributed to Col. Frederick, who had seen the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife while serving in Britain.[1]\\nWhile the V-42 had a double-edged blade similar to the Fairbairn–Sykes knife, the V-42 has a cross section with concave hollow ground blade facets, in contrast to the Fairbairn\\'s flat four sided diamond cross section. The narrower V-42 stiletto blade profile was designed to optimize penetration on thrusting; it could easily penetrate a G.I. steel helmet and liner with a single thrust.[1]  With its relatively thin, narrow blade, the V-42 was designed from the outset for use as a fighting knife, and was prone to breakage when used for utility chores such as opening ration tins or ammunition crates.  Unusually for military combat knives of the period, the V-42\\'s twin edges were double hollow-ground for increased cutting performance.[1]  The addition of the skull-cracking pommel was attributed to the input of Major Orval J. Baldwin, the FSSF Supply Officer.[1] The thumb groove on the V-42\\'s ricasso was designed to promote a flat grip with the thumb over the crossguard, which positioned the double-edged blade horizontally.  In this manner a user could slash an opponent with either a forehand or backhand stroke, while ensuring that his blade would slip between the ribs when used in a thrust or stab.[1][2]\\nThe V-42 was manufactured in the United States by W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co.[3]  After a series of leg injuries incurred during training, the original leather sheath was reinforced with metal in later versions designed to prevent the needle-like tip from penetrating the sheath.[2][3]  Since the force was originally trained for fighting in cold weather conditions, the sheath was designed long, so as to hang beneath the bottom of a G.I. parka.[4]\\nAfter receiving drawings of the proposed knife from its designers, prototypes of the V-42 were submitted by three knifemaking companies - Camillus Cutlery Co., Case Cutlery, and Cattaraugus Cutlery Co.  Captain Dermot Michael \"Pat\" O\\'Neill, the First Special Service Force\\'s close-combat instructor and a former Detective Sergeant of the Shanghai Municipal Police (the same police force in which Fairbairn and Sykes had served), recalled that Col. Frederick personally selected the Case prototype and gave authority for its acquisition.[1]\\nFirst issued in 1942, the V-42 was the standard issue fighting knife issued to the FSSF, whose members generally referred to it as the Force Knife or V-42 Stiletto. All members of the Force were trained extensively in its use, though only members of the Force\\'s Combat Echelon were actually issued their own V-42 knife.[2] In combat, the V-42 proved itself an excellent thrusting weapon that could easily penetrate leather and heavy clothing, though its needle tip would occasionally stick when contacting bone after a deep thrust, making the knife difficult to withdraw.[1] It has been claimed that some Force members re-ground the points of their knives to alleviate this, but Baldwin said that differences were due to variations in production, as the knives were hand-ground and largely hand-made.[1]\\nSome 70 V-42 knives were issued with short U.S. Marine Corps Raider knife scabbards.  This was confirmed by Case Cutlery shipping records, which indicate that some 70 V-42 knives were procured by the U.S. Navy and sent to the Brooklyn Navy Depot in late 1942 and early 1943.  The knives were issued in 1943 to crewmen serving in USS\\xa0Omaha Landing Force and Armed Boat Party while the ship was off the Florida coast at the start of a South Atlantic war patrol, searching for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.  While USS Omaha did encounter German blockade runners,[5] there were no recorded instances of the V-42 being employed against an opponent in combat. The 70 V-42s procured by the U.S. Navy were the only known V-42 knives sent to a unit or branch outside the First Special Service Force. US Army Paratroopers and Rangers also carried some of these knives as well.[2]\\nThe V-42 was depicted on the badges of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, Canadian Armed Forces, JTF2 and one of the United States Army Special Forces badges.[6]\\nW. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co. manufactured a post-war version from 1989 until 1993.[3]\\nThe V-42 weighs 7 ounces (0.20\\xa0kg), with either a 7.250-inch (18.42\\xa0cm) or 7.125-inch (18.10\\xa0cm) long blade and 5.5-inch (14\\xa0cm) handle, for a total length of approximately 12.5 inches (32\\xa0cm).  Its features included a double hollow-ground, stiletto-type blade equipped with a thumb-imprint choil or ricasso designed to facilitate a flat or modified saber grip, and a leather handle with a pointed skull-cracking pommel (butt).[7]  One source states that the Army placed five separate orders totaling 3,423 V-42 fighting knives from November 1942 through November 1943.[2]  However, Case factory records indicate that approximately 3,000 V-42 knives were actually produced, and only one shipment of 1,750 knives to the FSSF was recorded by the Force\\'s supply officer.[1]\\n'),\n",
       " ('Nihang',\n",
       "  'The Nihang (also spelt as Nihung lit. \"Crocodiles\") or Akali (lit. \"Immortals\"), also known as Dal Khalsa, is an armed Sikh warrior order originating in the Indian subcontinent.[1] Nihangs are believed to have originated either from Fateh Singh and the attire he wore[2] or from the \"Akal Sena\" (lit. Army of the Immortal) started by Guru Hargobind.[3] Early Sikh military history was dominated by the Nihang, known for their victories where they were heavily outnumbered. Traditionally known for their bravery and ruthlessness in the battlefield, the Nihang once formed the irregular guerrilla squads of the armed forces of the Sikh Empire, the Sikh Khalsa Army.\\nThe word Akali/akaali means timeless or immortal.\\nLiterally, one who belongs to Akaal  (beyond Time). In other words, an Akaali is that person who is subject of none but God only. Conceptually speaking, the terms Akaali, Khalsa and Sikh are synonymous. The term Akaali was first used during the time of Guru Gobind Singh Sahib. It became popular in the last decades of the eighteenth century.\\n\\nThe term came to be associated with “commitment, fearlessness, boldness, struggle, and justice.”[4]The word Nihang may come from the Persian word for a mythical sea creature (Persian: نهنگ).[5] The term owes its origin to Mughal historians, who compared the ferocity of the Akali with that of crocodiles. The meaning of Akali in Sikhism however, is the immortal army of Akal (God).[6]\\nAccording to Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech, there exists three main theories regarding the genesis of the Nihangs. These three theories are summarized below:[7]\\nTraditional Nihang dress is known as Khalsa Swarupa. This comprises full attire of navy blue selected by Guru Gobind Singh after conflicts with Vazir Khan, the Mughal Governor of Sirhind,[8] several edged bracelets of iron round on each of their wrists (jangi kara) and quoits of steel (chakram) tiered in their lofty conical blue turbans, together with the either a dori kirpan (an open blade kirpan that is worn with a rope attached and was meant to be used as a quick access weapon) or a pesh kabaz - a predecessor to the modern kirpan. When fully armed a Nihang will also bear one or two swords (either the curved talwar or the straight khanda, or another type of sword like saif or sarohi on his right hip), a katar (dagger) on his left hip, a buckler made from buffalo-hide (dhal) on his back, a large chakram around his neck, and an iron chain. In times of war, arms worn on the Nihang\\'s person would generally be reserved until the warrior lost the weapon he held, often a bow (kamaan) or spear (barcha). Armour consisted of sanjo or iron chainmail worn under an iron breastplate (char aina). Nihang war-shoes (jangi mozeh) were constructed of iron at the toe, making their pointed toes capable of inflicting cuts and stab wounds. The firearms carried by nihangs are either a toradar (matchlock) or a musket.[9][10] The Nihangs favour the dark blue colour for their clothing, which they adopted to emulate Guru Gobind Singh\\'s attire when he escaped from Chamkaur through the Machhiwara jungle.[11]\\nThe Nihang were particularly known for their high turbans (dastar bunga) and their extensive use of the chakram or war-quoit. Their turbans were often pointed at the top and outfitted with a chand torra or trident called astbhuja which could be used for stabbing in close-quarters. Other times, the turbans would be armed with a bagh naka (iron claw) and one or several chakram to slice at an opponent\\'s eyes. These steel-reinforced turbans, it was said, afforded enough protection so that there was no need for any other form of headgear. Today, Nihang still wear miniature versions of five weapons (pancha shastra) in their turbans, namely the chakram, the khanda (sword), the karud (dagger), the kirpan, and the tir (arrow).\\nThere are four main factions amongst the Nihangs of the modern-era, them namely being:[12][7]\\nOriginally created for older members (over 40) by splitting the Dal Khalsa into two.[13] Their headquarters are located in Raqba.\\nOriginally created for younger members (under 40) by splitting the Dal Khalsa into two. The Taruna Dal was further divided in five jathas, each with 1300 to 2000 men and a separate drum and banner.[14]\\nDescend from lineage of Bidhi Chand, a contemporary warrior and companion of the Sikh Gurus.[15][16]\\nProminent amongst Mazhabi Sikhs.\\nThe latter two groups being much less prominent than the former two. Each Dal consists of both a mobile and stationary group. The mobile group of the Budha Dal, for example, is the Dalpanth. There has been incidents of conflict in the past between different groups of Akalis, even within the same faction.[17]\\nSome Nihang groups consume cannabis or shaheedi degh (ਭੰਗ), purportedly to help in meditation.[18]\\n[19][20] Sūkha parshaad (ਸੁੱਖਾ ਪ੍ਰਰਸਾਦ), \"Dry-sweet\", is the term Nihang use to refer to it. It was traditionally crushed and taken as a liquid, especially during festivals like Hola Mohalla. It is never smoked, as this practice is forbidden in Sikhism.[21]\\nIn 2001, Jathedar (leader) Santa Singh, the leader of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of  shaheedi degh by the apex Sikh clergy - in order to preserve traditional Sikh practices.[22] \\nAccording to a recent BBC article, \"Traditionally they also drank shaheedi degh, an infusion of cannabis, to become closer with God\"[23]\\n\\nThe Nihangs carry the original Nishan Sahib, being navy/electric blue, and (sometimes) bright yellow or basanti with a tegha, dhal (shield) and katar. Yellow in Punjabi culture signifies sacrifice, revolt and honour while blue signifies courage, bravery and patriotism. In Punjab, Blue is the colour of Khalsa, and yellow the colour of Kshatriyas.[citation needed] Due to various passages from the Dasam Granth, the Nihangs see themselves as Kshatriyas, but believe that the varna system is not limited to ones heritage.The Nihang sect equally reveres the Guru Granth Sahib, Dasam Granth, and Sarbloh Granth.[24] They attribute the later two works to Guru Gobind Singh.[24] They consider the Dasam Granth and the Sarbloh Granth as extensions of the Guru Granth Sahib. As such, they refer to these scriptures as Sri Dasam Guru Granth Sahib, and Sri Sarbloh Guru Granth Sahib.[25] They call the Guru Granth Sahib, Aad Guru Granth Sahib. They also sometimes refer to the scriptures as \"Durbar\", such as Aad Guru Durbar. The Sarbloh Granth has another name, as Sri Manglacharan Purana. They believe that all three of these scriptures are authentic, written by the Gurus and are one and the same.[25] For this reason, they will often place the Dasam and Aad Granths on the same level and on the same throne (also known as the palki). They also sometimes do this for the Sarbloh Granth as well.\\nThe Nihangs have developed their own coded language, known as Khalsa bole.[26]\\nIn September 2023, a depiction of a Nihang Sikh was painted on the top-right section of an official illustration of the Dallas Cowboys football team as part of the Carpe Omnia (\\'seize everything\\') theme for the upcoming sports season.[27][28]\\n'),\n",

A female superhero is sometimes called a \"superheroine.\"\\nBy most definitions, characters need not have actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although sometimes terms such as \"costumed crimefighters\"[2] are used to refer to those without such powers who have many other common traits of superheroes.\\nFor a list of comic book supervillain debuts, see List of comic book supervillain debuts.\\nDespite its short run, it is seen as the earliest superhero fiction comic.[3]\\nOften cited as perhaps the earliest superhero akin to those to become popularized through American comic books.[4][5]\\nEvelyn Gaines\\n(Strong Man, Cuckoo Man, Tornado Man, Rope Man, Diaper Man)\\nWilliam Hanna & Joseph Barbera\\nWilliam Hanna & Joseph Barbera\\n'),\n",
       " ('Dashavatara',\n",
       "  '\\nThe Dashavatara (Sanskrit: दशावतार, daśāvatāra) are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, a principal Hindu god. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order.[1] The word Dashavatara derives from daśa, meaning \"ten\", and avatāra, roughly equivalent to \"incarnation\".\\nThe list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, particularly in respect to the inclusion of Balarama (brother of Krishna) or Gautama Buddha. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the \"most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha.\"[2][3][4][5][6][note 1] Most draw from the following set of figures, in this order:[7][8][9] Matsya; Kurma; Varaha; Narasimha; Vamana; Parashurama; Rama; Krishna or Balarama; Buddha[note 1] or Krishna; and Kalki. In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as Vithoba[10] or Jagannath[7] in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. All avatars have appeared except one; Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.\\nThe order of the ancient concept of Dashavataras has also been interpreted to be reflective of modern Darwinian evolution, as a description of the evolution of consciousness.\\n\"Dashavatara\" or \"daśāvatāra\" (दशावतार) means \"ten avatars\" or \"ten incarnations\":\\nAccording to Swami Parmeshwaranand, although the avatars of Vishnu are countless in number and include hermits, Manus, sons of Manus, and other Devas (gods), due to the curse of a Rishi called Bhrigu most are only partial (i.e. incomplete) incarnations. The Dashavatara is a list of the ten complete (i.e. full) incarnations.[13]\\nVarious versions of the list of Vishnu\\'s avatars exist, varying per region and tradition.[7][8][9][14] Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar,[14] while others, such as the Paripāṭal[citation needed] (c. 3rd-4th CE), which is the fifth of the Eight Anthologies (Ettuthokai) in the Sangam literature, and the Yatindramatadipika, a 17th-century summary of Sri Vaishnava doctrine,[9] give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth.[9] The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who do not accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.[15] One list in the Mahabharata gives Rama (Bhargava), Rama (Dasharathi), Satvata (Krishna or Balarama),[2] the Tri-Rama. The Tantric Prapanchasara (attributed to Adi Shankara, but disputed,[16]) also omits the Buddha. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the \"most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha.\"[2][3][4][5][6][note 1]\\nThe following table summarises the position of avatars within the Dashavatara in many but not all traditions:[7][8][9][10]\\n\\nThe Agni, Padma, Garuda, Linga, Narada, Skanda and Varaha Puranas mention the common (Krishna, Buddha) Dashavatara list.[note 9] The Garuda Purana has two lists, one longer list with Krishna and Buddha, and a list with Balarama and Buddha, which substitutes Vamana for Rama.[note 10] The Shiva Purana has Balarama and Krishna. The list with Krishna and Buddha is also found in the Garuda Purana Saroddhara, a commentary or \\'extracted essence\\' of the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the Purana itself, with which it seems to be confused):The Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-Lion, the Dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Krisna, Buddha, and also Kalki: These ten names should always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite them near the diseased are called relatives.Matsyah Kurmo Varahas-cha Narasimhas-cha Vamana\\nRamo Ramas-cha Ramas-cha Buddha Kalki-cha te dasa\\n\\nThe Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-lion, the Dwarf,\\nParasurama, Dasarathi Rama, Balarama, Buddha and Kalki – thy ten.[43][44]\\n—Sanctum entrance, Adivaraha cave (7th century), Mahabalipuram;earliest avatar-related epigraphy[45][46][note 11]\\nThe Buddha was included as one of the avatars of Vishnu under Bhagavatism by the Gupta period between 330 and 550 CE. The mythologies of the Buddha in the Theravada tradition and of Vishnu in Hinduism share a number of structural and substantial similarities.[48] For example, states Indologist John Holt, the Theravada cosmogony and cosmology states the Buddha covered 6,800,000 yojanas in three strides, including earth to heaven and then placed his right foot over Yugandhara – a legend that parallels that of the Vamana avatar in Hinduism. Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when dharma is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the dharma. These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.[48]\\nThe adoption of Buddha as an avatar in Bhagavatism was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism\\'s assimilation into Vaishnavism\\'s mythic hierarchy. By the 8th century CE, the Buddha was included as an avatar of Vishnu in several Puranas.[49][50] This assimilation is indicative of the Hindu ambivalence toward the Buddha and Buddhism,[51] and there is also a tradition that there were two Buddhas. According to this tradition, the first was the ninth avatar of Vishnu, while the second was the historical Buddha.[52][note 12] Conversely, Vishnu has also been assimilated into Sinhalese Buddhist culture,[55] and Mahayana Buddhism is sometimes called Buddha-Bhagavatism.[56] By this period, the concept of Dashavatara was fully developed.[57]\\nJayadeva, in his Pralaya Payodhi Jale from  the Gita Govinda, includes Balarama and Buddha where Krishna is equated with Vishnu and the source of all avatars.[58]\\nIn traditions that emphasize the Bhagavata Purana, Krishna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom everything else emanates. Gaudiya Vaishnavas worship Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan, or source of the incarnations.[59][60][61] The Vallabha Sampradaya and Nimbarka Sampradaya, (philosophical schools) go even further, worshiping Krishna not only as the source of other incarnations, but also Vishnu himself, related to descriptions in the Bhagavata Purana. Mahanubhavas also known as the Jai Kishani Panth, considers Krishna as the supreme God and do not consider the list of Dashavatara while consider another list of Panchavatara (5 Avatars).[62][63]\\nThirty-nine avatars are mentioned in the Pañcaratra including the likes of Garuda.[64][65] However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.[66]\\nThe term \"Jyotisha\" refers to Hindu or Vedic astrology, one of the six Vedangas or ancillary disciplines linked with the Vedas. The Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra mentions the Dashavatara as follows:\\nFrom the Sun God the Incarnation of Rama, from the Moon that of Krishna, from Mars that of Narasimha, from Mercury that of Buddha, from Jupiter that of Vamana, from Venus that of Parasurama, from Saturn that of Koorma (Tortoise), from Rahu that of Varaha [Boar] and from Ketu that of [Matsya] (fish) occurred. All other incarnations that these are through the Grahas. The beings with more Paramatmamsa [i.e. Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha] are called divine beings\\'.Notably, according to the Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra - an important Smriti Sastra or compilation of Indian astrology for prediction (i.e. fortune telling) - although all ten of the Dashavatara have corresponding astrological symbols, only four are considered as divine beings (i.e. Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha).\\nThe sun is the soul of all. The Moon is the mind. Mars is one\\'s strength. Mercury is speech-giver while Jupiter confers knowledge and happiness. Venus governs semen (potency) while Saturn denotes grief.\\n\\nOf royal status are the Sun and the Moon while Mars is the army chief. Prince-apparent in Mercury. The ministerial planets are Jupiter and Venus. Saturn is servant. Rahu and Ketu form the planetary army.\\nSome modern interpreters interpret Vishnu\\'s ten main avatars as an ascending order from simple life-forms to more complex life-forms, and see the Dashavataras as a reflection, or a foreshadowing, of the modern theory of evolution. Such an interpretation was first propounded by the Gaudiya Vaishnava saint Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his 1873 book Datta-kaustubha and again in his 1880 book Kṛṣṇa-saṁhita. Theosophist Helena Blavatsky also reiterated this in her 1877 opus Isis Unveiled.[69][70] Bhaktivinoda Thakura proposed the following ordering of the Dashavataras:\\nBlavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution.[71] Some Orientalists and reformist Hindus in India picked up this idea to rationalize Hinduism as being consistent with modern science. Keshub Chandra Sen[73] stated in 1882,\\nThe Puranas speak of the different manifestations or incarnations of the Deity in different epochs of the world history. Lo! The Hindu Avatar rises from the lowest scale of life through the fish, the tortoise, and the hog up to the perfection of humanity. Indian Avatarism is, indeed, a crude representation of the ascending scale of Divine creation. Such precisely is the modern theory of evolution.[69]Similarly Aurobindo regarded \"Avataric Evolutionism\" as a \"parable of evolution\", one which does not endorse evolutionism, but hints at \"transformative phases of spiritual progress\".[74] According to Nanda, the Dashavatara concept has led to some Hindus asserting that their religion is more open to scientific theories, and has not opposed or persecuted scientists midst them like the way Christianity and Islam has.[69] But, adds Nanda, Hinduism has many cosmological theories and even the Vaishnava one with Dashavatara concept does not explicitly teach evolution of species, rather it states an endless cycles of creationism.[69]\\nThe Dashavatara concept appealed to other scholars. Monier Monier-Williams wrote \"Indeed, the Hindus were ... Darwinians centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world.\"[75] J. B. S. Haldane(British-Indian scientist) suggested that Dashavatara gave a \"rough idea\" of vertebrate evolution: a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a man-lion, a dwarf and then four men (Kalki is not yet born).[76] Nabinchandra Sen explains the Dashavatara with Darwin\\'s evolution in his Raivatak.[77] C. D. Deshmukh also remarked on the \"striking\" similarity between Darwin\\'s theory and the Dashavatara.[78]\\nSome Vaishnava Hindus reject this \"Avataric Evolutionism\" concept. For example, Prakashanand states that this apologeticism degrades the divine status of Rama and Krishna, unduly sequences Rama as inferior to Krishna, both to the Buddha. Rama and Krishna are supremely divine, each right and perfect for the circumstances they appeared in, states Prakashanand.[79]\\n'),\n",
