# Analyzing the Perspective on the Fifa in Context of the 22 World Cup
## Outlet- and Topic-Wise sentiment over time

## Getting Started
As a Project done by multiple people, it is split into multiple subprojects and one data directory.
Each subproject should contain it's own readme with execution info.


## Contribute
You will likely use your own choice of programming language and environment. Please create one subdirectory in the git-projects root. Include a readme that explains how to set up and run your project.

Data to be used in further steps (Like CSVs etc) should (if not copyrighted!) be emitted into the data directory, or placed there locally if copyrighted.
